18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,It's just they probs have different distribution statistics an ivies all probably have similar
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,For what grads do
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,Kids at Harvard law went to better undergrads than kids at other law schools
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,And while I don't think that is the only determinant of the quality of the class
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,I think it is something that doesn't say nothing
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,I think it goes without saying that there are smart kids that go everywhere for undergrad
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:01 PM",No,Like the smartest person at uconn is probably as smart as anybody at Harvard
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:01 PM",No,"But on the aggregate, lots of people from quality schools is a good sign that the class is intelligent"
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,"(It could not be. If they took only the least intelligent kids from the top 20 schools to fill a law school class, that class would probably be less intelligent than uconn law)"
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,Harvard law should have a bunch of schools represented. The smartest kid from Townsend university should go to hls
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,But it should also have a bunch of people from top colleges
18609894948,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:04 PM",Yes,Word I feel you
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,Mich and duke have not had lots of kids from top colleges
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,And I did reading for a class at Cornell law and discussed it win my friend who is at the top of the class there when I visited
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,We disagreed about what part of the text meant and in class the professor brought that bit up and I was correct
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,(It was just a close reading thing)
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:06 PM",No,I just don't think that people at Cornell law are that smart and I don't want to go somewhere where I think I should be top of the class
18609894948,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:06 PM",Yes,go to chicago
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:06 PM",No,I'll see what it's like when I visit
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:35 PM",No,I have a feeling that only Harvard is legit though
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 2:36 PM",No,Like the duke professors were straight up bad
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:44 PM",No,But I'd definitely want good teachers and to have some confidence that the networks I made in school would be likely to have some value afterwards 
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:44 PM",No,"all of this seems to make the implicit assumption that undergrad selection of students is a meaningful filter, not just that it's accurate but that it provides additional information that the graduate selection of actually getting into those schools did not And doesn't contribute excess noise from things that are no longer relevant "
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:46 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:46 PM",No,I think my reasoning by analogy is stupid
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,But I also think the lsat and college grades are stupid
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,I think the sat is stupid
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,I don't trust any of these things
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,I think high school grades are literally the stupidest
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,Reasoning my analogy doesn't work because the analog is also super flawed
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,And people only really start to get smart around 16
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:48 PM",No,So like getting into college is like 1.5 years of being kind of intelligent
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:48 PM",No,People don't reach max intelligence until like 30
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:48 PM",No,So like college should honestly mean noting
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:48 PM",No,*nothing
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:48 PM",No,But I would be a hell of a lot more comfortable going to Harvard law
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,Also with the increased focus on extracurriculars for undergrad that just seems to add a lot of noise for relatively little signal in whose going to be a good lawyer
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,Honestly I think employment reports are probably the best bet
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,The incentives are aligned so that employers want to hire smart employees and actually care enough to do their own research
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,And it's practically relevant
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,Not necessarily
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,Although I guess you still need to decide who the good law firms are
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,Because different attributes are best for a bitch than a leader
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,And a salesman and a practitioner
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:53 PM",No,"Yeah so it's confined to which is the best at producing entry level roles, but those are the role that you're recruiting for"
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:53 PM",No,So even if it's limited in scope it's limited to the appropriate scope
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:53 PM",No,My end goal in life isn't to prepare myself to be the best entry level guy
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:53 PM",No,And the time between law school and partner seems too large for one to have a profound effect on the other
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:53 PM",No,It's to be the best something or other but at the same time be good enough to get into entry level and climb the ladder to
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:54 PM",No,O
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,I mean that makes sense but I think you develop that capability in practice not in school
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,So it does seem like a relevant thing to rate schools on 
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,Doesn't*
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:57 PM",No,The lsat is even dumber than the variation
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:58 PM",No,"Because it is definitey skill based and the more you study, the better you do"
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:58 PM",No,"Like unless you're god, in order to be the absolute best at something you're going to have to focus and specialize down to a pretty specific area, and schools might only have one or two classes in that area "
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 3:59 PM",No,Do you think practicing law won't be skill based?
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,It will be
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,It's just stupid you take it once
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,Or maybe it isn't
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,Maybe it is all about the stakes
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,Oh that's true
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,And feeling ready and preparing yourself for a deadline
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,And not fucking up the rules
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,Maybe the lsat is the perfect test
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,And I just interpreted it incorrectly
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,Eh I guess people do have critical trial days
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,I'm nervous about it being my worst test and also the only type of school I got into
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,That does not compute for me
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,That's reasonabl
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,Although you could look at it a different way
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,You still did objectively very well and this is just the type of school that weights doing well on tests highly
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,I could have killed it tho
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:09 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:09 PM",No,"That was in the cards, just not the hand you were dealt"
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,Yeah that's the thing about the lsat that is the stupidest
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:11 PM",No,But they might build that in on purpose
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:11 PM",No,They don't want all the best people to only live and work and study in one place
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:11 PM",No,So they build in randomness
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:11 PM",No,You aren't supposed to write a supplement unless your score between tests changes 7 points or more
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:11 PM",No,They know the test is random
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,But holy fuck. I want to be at Harvard
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,And you believe (I think correctly) that it's sensitive to definitely more than the closest 7
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,What do you mean?
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,I.e there are material differences in scores with a range less than 7
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:16 PM",No,I think somebody who scores a 180 consistently is more of a stud than somebody who scores a 173 consistently
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:16 PM",No,I think there is a reason 176 is the number
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:16 PM",No,I think it says something in a range up to 4
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:17 PM",No,That makes sense right?
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:17 PM",No,So like scores within a range of 4 are treated similar?
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:19 PM",No,"For bschool I've heard it's usually bucketed into groups of 30 points for the GMAT, with some additional sensitivity around the average score"
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:20 PM",No,No they dint bucket on the mcat
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:20 PM",No,They treat them as absolute
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:21 PM",No,I've shown you the curves on law school numbers
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:21 PM",No,Yeah but some of that's probably due to correlation with other factors 
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:21 PM",No,I doubt it
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:21 PM",No,"You don't think grades and LSAT scores correlate, or you don't think the explains the size of the effect?"
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:24 PM",No,Size of effect
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:25 PM",No,"So why dont they want you updating your app if there's a score difference but it's less than a certain amount, if they actually are sensitive to each difference?"
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:25 PM",No,Just administrative pain of processing all the updates or?
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:30 PM",No,No they see the score
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:30 PM",No,But you have to write an appendix for them if you go up by more than 7
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:30 PM",No,I guess less than 7 they average
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,What would the appendix say? 
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,I was sick the day of the first test and I studied a couple hundred hours before the second
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,Ah
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,They have to know which to throw out 
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,But I'm sure they just throw out the bad
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:33 PM",No,If you were nyu you would dmn well want more variation in the test
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:33 PM",No,Because you don't only want scrubs at nyu
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:33 PM",No,The only people interested in having the test have a small range are the top 3
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:34 PM",No,I can't be the only one with these thoughts
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:34 PM",No,They seem logical to me
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:35 PM",No,I guess how much does nyu want some of the tier above them versus how badly do they want to keep out the tier below them
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:35 PM",No,Seems like they'd benefit from taking more mixed
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 4:42 PM",No,There also might just be limitations to making hard tests with low variability of the test subjects ability has some day to day variance 
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:51 PM",No,"Just realized that I didn't have a rental car booked, called travel and in like 2 minutes I got one "

18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,Where are you?
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,Currently in Atlanta 
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,Flying to Jackson 
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,And yeah corporations can be really really good at what they do
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:54 PM",No,It does strike me as kind of weird that I'm able to just authorize that spending
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:58 PM",No,You've been a professional for 1.5 years man
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:59 PM",No,You're a legit adult
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 5:59 PM",No,Unlike us other children here
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:08 PM",No,It's still weird to be directly responsible for a project budget
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:16 PM",No,Do any of you know product managers at any of the big tech companies
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:29 PM",No,Brown kids get hired as pms at startups
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:32 PM",No,What about people at like Google/Apple/Microsoft/ibm
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:36 PM",No,Those people have mbas  worked there as programmers for 2+ years
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:40 PM",No,Read the bio of sundar pichai (new Google ceo) on buzzfeed
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:40 PM",No,It's really good
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:40 PM",No,India is so hype
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:40 PM",No,Both the Google and Microsoft ceos are Indian
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:40 PM",No,And Zuck loves india
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,"That would make sense, I'd like to explore if I have any options post MBA in that sort of a position and India is fucking gigantic"
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,"Just landed, first time in Mississippi "
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,I checked my predictit
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,Started with 300
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,Up to 424
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,That's pretty legit
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,You going to cash out on anything?
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,I might cash out of both trump winning and Hilary not winning
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:19 PM",No,I'm think about putting some on Bernie winning individual states
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:19 PM",No,But my big insights that played out were the math just doesn't support trump or Bernie
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,So I don't know what I would really bet on
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,My third bet was kasich winning Ohio when it was clear that Rubio was fucked in Florida and the establishment needed a candidate
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:23 PM",No,There was a piece on 538 about how the chance of trump winning and the chance of having a brokered convention only made sense if you thought he had a decent chance of winning a brokered convention
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,Paul Ryan is looking good
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,I should have bought him cheap
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,I could have bought him at 4
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,He's up to 16
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,How's mittens looking?
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,6?
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,I forget
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,I was thinking about buying a mix of Romney and ryan
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:26 PM",No,16 is pretty high 
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:26 PM",No,Kasich probs won't win a brokered
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,And ryan is a goddamn sexy stud
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,And both sides like him
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,He could very well be president
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,He could totally win a brokered
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,This is such a weird election
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,(If they change the rules)
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,And then Hilary will face an indictment for the emails
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,And then Ryan is president
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,And he has a great story
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,He is refusing to run right now
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,I still feel like I don't fully understand the whole Clinton email thing 
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Neither do I
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Why did she need a private email server
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Who has those?
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,She's 70
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Also she doesn't know anything about tech
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,"Also, you can search some emails online and she has some horrible things"
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,Yeah all of the above 
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,She like arranges what can and cannot be said in various news shows
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,"As far as I can't tell, it's some evil corrupt shit"
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,Weird
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:32 PM",No,"Still, bill as first dude sounds like a great time"
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,Ehhhh the us did some bad things under bill
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,Glass stiegel
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,Some disrupting of foreign dictators
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,(Via coupes)
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,Yeah but have you listened to bill speak? You sleep so much more soundly afterwards
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,I don't know much cause I didn't study history and I was young
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,Also I feel like we've always been doing coupes
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,Like at least post ww2
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:35 PM",No,Look up military bases of us around the world
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:35 PM",No,And then some other random countries
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:35 PM",No,We basically occupy the world
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:35 PM",No,It's really crazy
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:35 PM",No,"But historically, China is number 1"
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:35 PM",No,I mean don't we still have a ton of Cold War remnant bases
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:36 PM",No,"Is giving China tech, which will give us money in the short term, will fuck us in the long term"
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:36 PM",No,(I read some of kissingers book called on China. It's really bad and boring)
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,That's a shame
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,I thought he was supposed to be good
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,He can't write for shit
18607168967,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,But he writes a lot
18609676168,"Apr 3, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,Ah
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:52 AM",Yes,I want to buy big on trump not being the nominee 
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,It's not worth that much anymore
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,You have to buy for 60 cents
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,I bought at 30
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",Yes,So is it gonna be cruz then?
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,But you can still make a lot if you think you know who it will be
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,Cruz is 26
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,Ryan is 16
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,Kasich is 14
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,I forget the rest
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",Yes,I honestly donÍt know the rules well enough
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,They are going to change
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",Yes,But it seems pretty absurd that any of them could win
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:54 AM",Yes,trump has no chance
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,The rules currently stand that a brokered has to go to somebody who won 8 primaries
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:55 AM",Yes,cruz is like the 2nd worst candidate they could pick
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,So basicaly only trump would be eligible
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:55 AM",Yes,kasich won nothing
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,But they will change the rules at the convention
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:55 AM",Yes,and ryan didnÍt run
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,Exactly Lebow
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:56 AM",No,"I don't know the procedure for the rules to change, but it is clear that they will change"
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:56 AM",Yes,democrats are gonna win like every state
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:56 AM",No,The other odd thing going on is in the democratic election
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:56 AM",Yes,but thats different
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:56 AM",Yes,sanders canÍt win
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:57 AM",Yes,because there are only 2 candidates
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,That's what the media says
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,But here is the deal
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:57 AM",Yes,so even if hillary limps across the finish she wins
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,The numbers with sanders requiring 70% of remaining votes INClUDE most of the super delegate on Hilary's side
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,But that's not a given
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:57 AM",Yes,also the nevada caucus is actually the stupidest thing IÍve ever heard
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:58 AM",Yes,meh he canÍt get enough
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:58 AM",No,The concept of a super delegate was created (I think) to make it so earlier conventions mattered less
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:58 AM",No,"For example, if state x went first but later on it changed its mind because of new things that came out 3 months later"
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,Super delegates could go the other way to offset stupid initial thoughts
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,Basically super delegates were created with a candidate like Bernie sanders in mind
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:59 AM",Yes,super delegates donÍt matter at all
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:59 AM",Yes,he still canÍt win
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,Where momentum just shifts
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 11:59 AM",Yes,theyÍve never gone against the pledged leader and they arenÍt gonna start now
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,Instead they are currently being used as a pawn of the instituion
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,Whoever gets more delegates will get the super delegates
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,In a race with two candidates
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,It would be crazy otherwise
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,So we should just throw them away and pretend they don't exist
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:01 PM",Yes,i think its gonna be ryan v hillary
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,Ryan has a sexy story
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,Refusing to run
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:01 PM",Yes,that he didnÍt go to college
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,Being asked by the party to take up the mantle in his time of need
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,*it's
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,*its
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,Ryan is basically the anti Hilary
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,"He has to get begged to do things (be vp, lead congress), where she is like slobbering at the mouth"
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,He could beat her in a general for sure
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",Yes,yeah
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,He is so cool
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",Yes,no one else could
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Romney could
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Hilary is really weak in a genral
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,"Remember, she can be indicted at any time"
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Obama probably wouldn't do it
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,But any press for Hilary is bad press
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,Also her voice is just the most annoying thing of all time
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,I'm thinking about buying some ryan stock
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:04 PM",Yes,yeah heÍs gotta be the most undervalued
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:04 PM",Yes,heÍs gotta have the best chance
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:05 PM",Yes,theres like 100% its going to a vote which would have to be cruzææryan
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:06 PM",Yes,you should buy ryan
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:06 PM",Yes,you can always sell when he rises
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:06 PM",Yes,and theres 100% chance he rises
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,I'll put my profit in ryan
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,Like 100 bucks
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,I'll sell at 30
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:07 PM",No,Ryan is a sexy stud
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:07 PM",Yes,really you shouldÍve just bet leicester city to win the premier league title 
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:07 PM",Yes,you wouldÍve made real money
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:09 PM",Yes,actually the craziest story in sports in the last 10+ years
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:09 PM",No,Just bought Ryan
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:10 PM",No,I've never even heard ryab Speak
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 12:12 PM",No,Should I put money down for wisconsin
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 3:33 PM",No,It's really weird meeting people in person that you've been talking to on the phone for a year and a half
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,Also this has definitely been the most boringest go-live I've been at
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,Nothing's breaking in interface land
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,Why are go lives hard?
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,You are literally just installing software
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,And like probably on servers that you made the hospitals buy and computers you said worked with it
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,It should like not even be a thing
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,Yheres a ton of configuration option that influence lots of other options
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,Why don't you guys just give them all new computers too
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,The problem is that we work to make our software adapt to their workflows
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,Also all of it should be standardized 
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,Like there should only be one workflow
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,This whole thing is stupid
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",Yes,its all individualized software
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",Yes,its super customized
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,Which is stupid
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,If workflows across hospitals were standardized and everyone was using the same code set it would be easy
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:51 PM",No,But doctors already hate us enough without hs trying to force standardization 
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:52 PM",No,So instead we build insanely configurable software but the timelines are usually too tight for excellent testing
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:52 PM",Yes,its stupid how customizable it is
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:52 PM",Yes,you move from 1 hospital to another and suddenly its an entirely different workflow
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:52 PM",No,"Plus a lot of people have similar mentalities to David in that ""how hard can it be to install software? Isn't it just double clicking an .exe?"""
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:52 PM",No,If the second hospital even has that workflow
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:53 PM",No,Or maybe instead they don't quite have that functionality and instead outsource it to another group
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:53 PM",No,It's insane
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:53 PM",Yes,like i didnÍt even understand how to use the app i was working on
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:53 PM",Yes,i would try to test something and not know how to check a patient in and then just eventually give up
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:53 PM",No,lol get rekt
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:54 PM",No,"That happens to me so much tho because I don't even have a discrete app, it's just like we did this workflow but there wasn't an interface message"
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:54 PM",No,And I have to figure out what the workflow is/if it's even the correct one
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:54 PM",Yes,"its actually insane, how epic ever became so big is beyond me"
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:54 PM",Yes,its like not good software
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:55 PM",Yes,and yeah you can set it up to do anything but first you need to spend 6 months finding the guy who knows how to set it up like that
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:55 PM",No,It supports a lot of stuff
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:55 PM",No,But it's pretty unwieldy 
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:56 PM",No,Also there's so many things that you'll only know exactly how they work by reading the server code
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:57 PM",No,But we don't let customers read our code so their knowledge is rarely complete
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:57 PM",No,"And even if we did, there's so much code"
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 4:58 PM",No,Like the fact that epic consulting is a thriving industry speaks volumes
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:00 PM",No,I did hear a story of one customer who tried to shortcut the install process by just getting a copy of another customers Production server without any of the dynamic data
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:01 PM",No,I think it actually worked okay-ish
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,I'm in the fourth quartile of the berkley wait list
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,Wtf
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,Does that mean I am at the bottom of the list???
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:38 PM",No,What the actual fuck 
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,Med school?
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,Law wchoo
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,Actually?
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,Wtf is their selection criteria?
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,Gpa majorly
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,RNG?
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:40 PM",No,Oh
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,So it makes sense but also like wtf
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,I got 90k from similar schools
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,And into a better one
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,I mean brown has like a 5.2 median gpa
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,I hate everything
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 7:31 PM",Yes,sobans like 35
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 7:31 PM",Yes,thats pretty crazy
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 7:41 PM",No,Managing director of hbs admissions has to be like 30-33
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 7:41 PM",No,He graduated hbs in 2013
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,Being the admissions director for hls isn't hard
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:26 PM",No,Oh
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:27 PM",No,You should probably just tell her that and then she'll let you in
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:27 PM",No,You just look at stats
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,Right now yeah
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,Hbs is easy too
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,But you still have to drum up interest and try to come up with a way to win cross offers
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,No it's Harvard
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,No one likes to see acceptance rates rise or yield decline
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,Hbs you look at stats and then use a dartboard
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:30 PM",No,Nah it's a ton of liberal arts grads who think they have an objective way to rate people in a holistic manner
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:30 PM",No,Not nearly as efficient as a dartboard 
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,Why do liberal arts people get jobs making more than the science people
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,How come the science people get the dick?
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:32 PM",No,On average they don't
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,The far right peak is non science
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,It's multi-monda
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,*modal
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,But really good soft skills generally have higher ceilings than really good hard skills because most of the huge decisions have to be made in very uncertain conditions
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:34 PM",No,And getting a large enough consensus to act relies more on soft skills than hard skills
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:36 PM",No,But average hard skills are considerably more rare than average soft skills so have a better premium in most of the middle area
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:36 PM",No,That's my theory at least
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Also hard skills are more prone to become commoditized because it's easier to specify and measure them and commodification caps price
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:37 PM",Yes,Dude like every really rich dude is science/tech
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:38 PM",No,Eh
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:38 PM",No,The most common major for F500 CEOs is a history major
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:38 PM",Yes,But that's not billions 
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:39 PM",No,That's true
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:40 PM",No,I would still imagine that most billionaires got that way through non technical positions with notable exceptions for some notable startup founders 
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:40 PM",No,"But I'm not really sure if manager, banker, w/e is closer to liberal arts or science"
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:40 PM",Yes,I mean most get there via inheritance 
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Untrue
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Majority are self made
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:41 PM",Yes,Even so if you broke it up science v arts v inheritance I bet on inheritance 
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Majority of billionaires were inherited millionaires 
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,I'd buy its a plurality
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:42 PM",Yes,How much do you need to make to be considered self made
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,"I'm not sure, I'd say somewhere between 2xing and 10xing your net worth, with adjustments for inflation"
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:43 PM",Yes, That's not even in the same ballpark as difficulty to do it from 1 mil or less
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,A small loan of a million dollars
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,That's why most of them inherited millions or multimillionaire 
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:44 PM",Yes,If you do it from a million im very impressed
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:44 PM",Yes,Donald got more though right?
18609676168,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,If you get to a billion from 10 million in very impressed
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,He started with a loan of a mil according to him
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:46 PM",Yes,But then he got more when daddy died
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:46 PM",No,Way more
18609894948,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:46 PM",Yes,What's that most money anyone ha ever lost in a lifetime
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:46 PM",No,Plus all the real estate contacts and stuff
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:46 PM",No,A bunch give away a lot
18607168967,"Apr 4, 2016, 8:47 PM",No,And monarchs fall

18609676168,"Apr 5, 2016, 9:39 PM",No,It'd be so interesting to watch if you had at least semi rational participants 
18609894948,"Apr 5, 2016, 9:39 PM",Yes,But the interesting part is how irrational people are
18607168967,"Apr 5, 2016, 9:42 PM",No,What are penny auctions?
18609676168,"Apr 5, 2016, 9:42 PM",No,Low prices but losers still pay their bid
18609894948,"Apr 5, 2016, 9:43 PM",Yes,And every time you bid it usually extends the time limit on the auction
18607168967,"Apr 5, 2016, 9:43 PM",No,I like the online thing where you have to pay money to buy the right to bid
18607168967,"Apr 6, 2016, 9:23 AM",No,Oh that is what penny auctions are and you were referencing the oc on reddit

18609676168,"Apr 9, 2016, 3:33 PM",No,It's already gotten incredibly finicky
18609676168,"Apr 9, 2016, 3:35 PM",No,Hmm a week is actually a good amount of time if you use it well
18609676168,"Apr 9, 2016, 3:40 PM",No,"Build something, learn something, or do something "
18609676168,"Apr 9, 2016, 3:41 PM",No,Conan o'Brien at Dartmouths 2011 commencement is pretty good
18609676168,"Apr 9, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,The president keeps laughing uncontrollably 
18609676168,"Apr 9, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,Just sent out the stock market game invites
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 12:17 AM",No,"I'm on tinder at uchicago. No matches yet, but I think I'm going there"
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 10:58 AM",No, Have you visited/are you going to visit there?
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:27 PM",Yes,I just filed my taxes 
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:27 PM",Yes,It's so difficult to file taxes 
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:27 PM",Yes,There's no reason it should be so hard
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,Turbo tax isn't too bad
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",Yes,Yeah but it's expensive 
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,TRUE
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,That's why the intuit founder is a billionaire
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",Yes,Why doesn't the us government automatically pull w2 info onto their forms
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",Yes,It wouldn't be that hard
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:49 PM",Yes,And then they could just have one form asking about different deductions
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:49 PM",Yes,And then that could be that
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,It's definitely very far from optimal
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,But I'm sure turbo tax and accountants and tax lawyers and probably some lobbiests benefit immensely from tax complexity 
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,All they have to do is require companies to do their employees taxes
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:52 PM",No,Like companies already do most of the work
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:54 PM",Yes,Also turbo tax is good but like it costs whatever it does initially and then they wanted $45 to do more than one state (since I had both CT and WI)
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:54 PM",Yes,And then they wanted $25 per state to actually file them
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:54 PM",No,It's a tax on taxes
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:54 PM",No,And a monopoly
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:55 PM",No,Seems totally legit and not like corruption
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:55 PM",Yes,So I just did Wisconsin with turbo tax and ct on my own and then copied down all the info turbo tax generate to file on my own
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,It's crazy how Ivy League someone looks after attending one
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,looking at pics of people in high school bs after college
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:59 PM",No,It's sophomore year when they buy the new clothes
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 1:59 PM",No,And then senior year when they have come to embody the school
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,There were guys at duke law asw wearing sneakers
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,I judged them hard
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:01 PM",Yes,At Harvard it was casual dress
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:01 PM",Yes,Everyone was wearing t shirts 
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:01 PM",No,Haha I doubt it
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:01 PM",No,I don't buy that for a second
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,I think you wore a tshirt and other people judged you but you aren't fashion conscious
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,You will be a few months in
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:02 PM",Yes,No they legit were
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:03 PM",Yes,I was wearing a button down and felt overdressed
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,I think turbotax does have a competitor and that it does have a free version for just federal taxes
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,And people at hbs were generally dressed pretty well
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,The students or the asw kids?
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:04 PM",Yes,The asw kids
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:04 PM",Yes,The students were all wearing t shirts
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,Who went to ivies?
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,Tshirt aren't necessarily not hip
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,What shoes were they wearing?
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",Yes,I dunno lol
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",Yes,Wasn't paying that much attention
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",Yes,But they did specifically say casual dress for the weekend
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",Yes,So that's probably why
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,I think we had some sort of accepted students brunch for 2+2 and I feel like I still wore my suit but I'm not sure and I don't remember what our dress instructions were
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,Haha helitEr is going to be that kid who only wears a suit
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,That would be so funny
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,Yo I know a girl at Harvard law
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,They dress up hard core
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,Their pics
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:16 PM",No,Yo I have time to grab food this week
18605603559,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,But that's it lol
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 2:17 PM",Yes,Let's gym today
18609894948,"Apr 10, 2016, 7:59 PM",Yes,do you guys know how to use latex
18609676168,"Apr 10, 2016, 8:17 PM",No,No
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 8:18 PM",No,We had to use it in Engin and cs
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 8:18 PM",No,I don't remember anything other than there are only like 4 things you use
18607168967,"Apr 10, 2016, 8:18 PM",No,"Something like ""title"" ""section"" ""subsection"" and ""math script"""
18605603559,"Apr 11, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,David we just got to the gym
18605603559,"Apr 11, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,Heard you won't swipe Brian
18607168967,"Apr 11, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Getting over a cold dude
18607168967,"Apr 11, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Haven't really left the house in two weeks
18605603559,"Apr 11, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Ur a bitch lol
18607168967,"Apr 11, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Thanks bae
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:52 PM",No, Also we had this guy come in to talk about population health this morning
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:53 PM",No,"It was pretty good, definitely an area the industry is focusing a ton more on"
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:54 PM",No,I'm wondering if/when we'll actually see a large shift away from fee for service 
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:54 PM",No,For doctor fees?
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:55 PM",No,Several top hospitals do it (for example cleveland clinic I think)
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:55 PM",No,And don't hmos do that?
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,Yeah for doctor fees and hmos are just the insurance side I thought
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,"Word, I think you are right"
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,It's important for doctors too because incentives for procedures/more expensive drugs are generally bad
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,And interfere with quality of care
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,"Yeah, the incentives for fee based care are really fucked"
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,That was a lot of his points
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,He also had a slide of a graph of various factors effect on health alongside a graph of their costs 
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,And medical interventions were 15-20% and 88% respectively 
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,Whereas assorted healthy habits were 50% and 4% respectively
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,Word
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,Preventative care is really important and I think interventional care only adds like 4 years per person
18607168967,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,(Could have made that up)
18609676168,"Apr 12, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,That sounds right-ish

18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:36 PM",Yes,In that photo
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,Zoom in though
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:47 PM",Yes,Dude this movie is fucking nuts
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:47 PM",Yes,These were straight up criminals
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,Not in the book
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,(I haven't seen the movie)
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:48 PM",Yes,No I meant the banks
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:48 PM",Yes,Like they realized they were holding shit
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:48 PM",Yes,And for months told people it was worth a ton and then sold all of it
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,If they misrepresented the value then it's criminal
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,"But if the buyers just made bad bets, it's on them"
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:50 PM",Yes,No this was beyond the point of making bets
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:50 PM",Yes,The subprime market was already collapsing
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:50 PM",Yes,And the bonds that were literally betting on stuff that had already collapsed held their value
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:54 PM",Yes,Also this Michael Burry dude is possibly the most interesting person ever
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,Is that the autistic one
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,With the glass eye
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:54 PM",Yes,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,Who is a swimmer and an md
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:55 PM",Yes,And also created credit default swaps
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,He's a crazy genius
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,He didn't even have an analyst
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,He just did the shit by himself
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 9:55 PM",Yes,He literally created the entire market
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,I'm so tired
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:21 PM",Yes,I still donÍt get who was actually buying these mortgages
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:21 PM",Yes,Was it all Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:21 PM",No,Lots of investment banks
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:21 PM",No,Bear sterns
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:21 PM",No,A couple other
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:21 PM",Yes,But not really
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:21 PM",Yes,They were just acting as brokerage firms
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:22 PM",No,Foreign investment firms
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:22 PM",No,No bear sterns owned a lot
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:22 PM",Yes,And then in the end they couldnÍt sell what they had and that caused a huge loss
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:22 PM",Yes,But mostly the banks were just brokering deals
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:22 PM",No,That's why there is no more bear sterns
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:23 PM",Yes,"Lehman's loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages; whether Lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds, or made a conscious decision to hold them, is unclear."
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:23 PM",Yes,So lehman had a large position but possibly because they couldnÍt sell what they had
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,Not being able to sell what you have is not brokering
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,Brokering is connecting a buyer and a seller
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,They owned the bonds 
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,So did bear
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:24 PM",Yes,Well they would buy them and then sell them
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,Yes
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:24 PM",Yes,At some point they couldnÍt sell what they had any more
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Yes
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,You have described owning a security
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:26 PM",No,Lots of banks held large amounts of the bonds and just ate the loss
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:26 PM",No,And then there were large foreign funds in the book that bought the debt
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:26 PM",No,But the author of the books states at the end that he could only account for like 10% of the mbs out there
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:27 PM",No,And he's not sure who bought the rest
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:27 PM",No,He thinks lots of large banks ate the loss mostly
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:42 PM",No,Have you guys read liars poker?
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:43 PM",Yes,ya
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:43 PM",No,A few chapters
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:44 PM",No,A lot of times the banks would enter positions and then if they ended up looking like shit they'd try to load them on to their retail investors
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:44 PM",No,So they were originally long on CDOs and then when they realized they were shit they sold them
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:44 PM",No,And afterwards corrected the price
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:44 PM",Yes,I still donÍt get it
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:44 PM",Yes,They arenÍt complicated
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:44 PM",Yes,Why would anyone buy one of these CDOs
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",No,High yield on a triple a rated bond
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",No,Triple a rated bonds didn't default 
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",No,Why wouldn't you buy
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",Yes,Mortgage securities were set up so that junk mortgages got paid last
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",Yes,These were junk mortgages
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",Yes,Why would you buy them
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",No,You know that now
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",Yes,They were B rated at the time
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",No,At the time you just probably knew it was a triple a rated bond based on mortgages
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:45 PM",Yes,They knew they were getting paid last
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:46 PM",No,"The mortgage bonds were B rated, the CDOs were triple a"
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:46 PM",Yes,But if you bought a CDO wouldnÍt you look inside it?
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:46 PM",Yes,ThatÍs your entire job
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:46 PM",No,And you see 2000 mortgages
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:46 PM",No,Whose job
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:46 PM",Yes,Why is it so criminal that rating agencies didnÍt look at these CDOs but the people that bought them werenÍt expected to look at them at all
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:46 PM",Yes,If you buy a stock you look at what the company does
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:47 PM",Yes,If you buy a fund you look at what it invests in
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:47 PM",No,That's because stocks are relatively transparent 
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:47 PM",Yes,How come when you buy a CDO you just take rating agencies as god
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:47 PM",Yes,Especially when these rating agencies are underfunded/way smaller than your bank
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:47 PM",Yes,And corrupt
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:47 PM",No,Because that was their job and it was a ton of work to do their job for you
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:48 PM",No,I don't trust TSA but I also don't go around inspecting other passengers before boarding a plane
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:48 PM",No,"Because that's not my job, even tho if they're carrying explosives I die"
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:48 PM",Yes,How hard is it to get a percentage breakdown of what mortgages are rated inside a CDO
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:48 PM",No,It's easy to know all the right questions to ask after the fact
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:48 PM",Yes,If your job is to buy bonds
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:49 PM",Yes,To make money
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:49 PM",Yes,I would expect you look at what youÍre buying
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:49 PM",No,"But it was relatively few people's jobs to buy bonds to make money, most were just trading where they didn't really expect to hold for long enoug for the underlying thing to have value"
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:49 PM",Yes,If all these people did is buy bonds rated by other agencies why did they even have a job
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:50 PM",No,Like a lot of traders never fundamentally understand what they're buying 
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:50 PM",Yes,Well then what the fuck is their job
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:50 PM",No,To make money by spotting market trends or pawning them off to retail investors 
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:51 PM",Yes,Well thatÍs bullshit
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:51 PM",No,S&T is not looking for fundamentals 
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:51 PM",Yes,They canÍt beat the S&P anyways
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:51 PM",Yes,Like I truly donÍt understand how this is such a high paying job and big industry when they donÍt do shit
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:51 PM",Yes,They donÍt look at what theyÍre buying and they donÍt beat benchmarks
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:52 PM",No,Different discussion but yeah it's another one worth having
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:53 PM",Yes,I just donÍt get how everyone says ñoh this was so complicated and no one knew what they were buyingî but its not complicated at all
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 10:53 PM",Yes,ItÍs just no one looked
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:00 PM",No,That's probably a better description
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:00 PM",No,But I think it takes a lot of hindsight to be able to say people should have looked at this in these ways and determined that
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:00 PM",Yes,I really donÍt think it does
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:01 PM",Yes,Like a) somebody packaged these securities together
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:01 PM",Yes,b) there was a ratings agency tasked with looking at the securities
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:01 PM",Yes,c) you should know what youÍre buying
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:01 PM",Yes,How the fuck did no one know?
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,Are you familiar with the principal-agent problem?
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,Most investments aren't fundamentally understood by the people whose cash is used to purchase them
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:03 PM",No,The ratings agencies should have known and maybe did but acted poorly 
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:04 PM",No,No you guys are missing the important point
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:04 PM",No,They did the math assuming that mortgages failing were independent
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:04 PM",No,So the mortgage backed securities seemed solid
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:05 PM",Yes,Ok except no one in their right mind would think that
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,It's what they did 
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:05 PM",Yes,IÍm going to assign a probability that the ground next to me will be wet without taking into account if IÍm getting wet
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,Makes the math easier
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:06 PM",Yes,Also though I donÍt get that anyways
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,Get what?
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:06 PM",Yes,Regardless of who failed the bottom level wasnÍt going to get paid if it was above a certain percent
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,It would have to be a higher default rate than ever before in history
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,And it was
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,Because the standards for giving loans were lower than ever before
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,Because the federal guidelines were relaxed
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,By bush
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:07 PM",Yes,By Clinton
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,"He had a ""let everybody get a house"" initiative"
18607168967,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,"Clinton did the ""let banks do what they want initiative"""
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:09 PM",Yes,It wasnÍt just subprime mortgages that failed though
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:10 PM",Yes,Anyways what IÍm taking away from this is that this was way easier to predict then everyone says and people are stupid as shit
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:11 PM",Yes,Do you think Breanna Stewart got laid at Uconn?
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:20 PM",No,"You're benefitting so much from hindsight, it was another bubble that some people did in fact see but most didn't because bubble"
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:20 PM",No,If you're saying people should have done something they didn't then you're missing whatever stopped them from doing that
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:21 PM",Yes,If that was my job I wouldÍve seen it
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,That's a nice sentiment 
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,(Also some people did and the ratings agencies might have as well)
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:25 PM",Yes,Yeah but no one at the banks
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:25 PM",Yes,If I was a trader at the bank
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:25 PM",Yes,I would want to look at what I was buying
18609676168,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,I mean they eventually caught on enough to know to not price them correctly until they offloaded them
18609894948,"Apr 15, 2016, 11:26 PM",Yes,Yeah after the market collapsed
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 12:25 AM",No, There's also a big difference between knowing somethings junk and knowing somethings junk and when it'll fail 
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 3:09 AM",No,Like plenty of people could have realized it was junk and decided to not invest but that's a pretty quiet signal 
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Dude pickle back shots are awesome
18605603559,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:14 PM",No,Lol are u a freshman
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:24 PM",No,Basically
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:24 PM",No,Wisconsin finally got warm and everyone's out
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:24 PM",No,It's sweet
18605603559,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:32 PM",No,I can come visit this summer
18609894948,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:33 PM",Yes,Boyu and I are gonna sublet in Madison for the summer
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:34 PM",No,Make some plans so I can get it on the books
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 4:35 PM",No,Between HonorHealth and Watson clinic I'm traveling kind of a lot but if I can book some vacation days they won't put me on a trip that week
18607168967,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:10 PM",No,Wait that would be sick
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,I'd also be down to meet up in another city although we do need to figure out living arrangements
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,Also I just signed a lease for next year and it looks like I'm currently going to be homeless for the first two weeks of August 
18607168967,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,Sounds like a good short story will come out of it
18607168967,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,(If you actually aren't a baby and try living on the street)
18609894948,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:25 PM",Yes,Why are you moving
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:26 PM",No,Nick and nicholas are going with some of their other friends and none of us are really in the hub often enough to justify paying for the amenities
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:29 PM",No,I kind of just want to get a tent and live at epic for a couple weeks
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:29 PM",No,#productivity
18609894948,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:30 PM",Yes,I was reading about a dude who lived at aol headquarters for a month
18609894948,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:30 PM",Yes,He didn't even work there
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:30 PM",No,Aol?
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:30 PM",No,And lol
18609676168,"Apr 16, 2016, 5:31 PM",No,Do people still work there?

18609894948,"Apr 16, 2016, 9:15 PM",Yes,I can but honestly it doesnÍt sound like my sister would be able to go which might mean I could be more flexible. If thereÍs a time that works well for you

18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 3:29 PM",No,Lebow did you get into stanford?
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 3:35 PM",No,I was thinking you guys could pick me up in Madison and we'd eventually end up in Denver and then I could fly from Denver to Phoenix 
18609894948,"Apr 19, 2016, 4:41 PM",Yes,No word from Stanford
18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 4:41 PM",No,Did you check your online status?

18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 4:50 PM",No,
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:08 PM",No,How would you guys feel about week of July 11th instead?
18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,I like june more
18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,I'm amenable though
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:11 PM",No,"Well it sounds like Brian wouldn't be very available until the 27th, and the week after that I have the after hours pager so I couldn't travel that week"
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:12 PM",No,And I'd ideally like to travel the week after i road trip with you guys so you can just drop me off at a major airport 
18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:12 PM",No,For me it's the earlier the better
18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:13 PM",No,Because I want it to actually happen and I want more than a month to recover before school
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:14 PM",No,"If we can get dates that work then I'll request vacation and at that point I'm committed, when's school start for you?"

18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:14 PM",No,But between late August and late September
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:16 PM",No,I could also do it if we did the week of June 20th and I might be able to switch the after hours pager with someone but that might be difficult because no one wants it on July 4th
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:17 PM",No,Alternatively you guys could just spend a long weekend in Madison and then you can do that whenever you want
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:17 PM",No,If everyone's free to talk on the phone it might be easier to solve it that way
18607168967,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:18 PM",No,Agreed
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 6:21 PM",No,Is everyone free in 2 hours to talk?

18609894948,"Apr 19, 2016, 10:57 PM",Yes,"Adam would you be joining Friday, July 15 or a different day?"
18609676168,"Apr 19, 2016, 10:59 PM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Apr 19, 2016, 10:59 PM",Yes,Ok I have us getting you at the airport in Pheonix and you starting with us at the Grand Canyon

18607168967,"Apr 20, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,4 weeksish
18607168967,"Apr 20, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,I'm totally addicted
18607168967,"Apr 20, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Just saw my legs in a mirror while sitting down
18607168967,"Apr 20, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,They look so weird
18607168967,"Apr 20, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,Elliptical gives you a weird shape
18609676168,"Apr 20, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,Elliptical is just weird overall
18609894948,"Apr 20, 2016, 9:51 PM",Yes,Adam and David - as soon as you know these dates work for you can you confirm with me? I want to start reserving campgrounds because it actually looks like some are already taken

18609894948,"Apr 21, 2016, 5:27 PM",Yes,I think the rule is actually that you canÍt trade a stock for more than 10% of itÍs daily volume 
18607168967,"Apr 21, 2016, 5:28 PM",No,Wait what small thing did you try to buy?

18609676168,"Apr 21, 2016, 5:35 PM",No,Yeah there's still a volume limit because that'd be really dumb to remove
18609676168,"Apr 21, 2016, 5:35 PM",No,If you actually bought even 10% of daily volume there's a good chance you'd move the price

18607168967,"Apr 21, 2016, 7:53 PM",No,Should I do it?

18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:50 AM",No,The kid I tutor in math is a junior in hs and probably at the same level as we were in 7th grade
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:51 AM",No,Good luck with Editas 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:51 AM",No,Actual successful stock trading does take nerves of steel

18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:59 AM",No,Their official budget is 91.5k/year
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:59 AM",No,All the money was given away months ago
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:59 AM",No,They should match the offer from a comparable school
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:59 AM",No,to people they accepted first :/
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:59 AM",No,Everybody turned down the money though
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:00 AM",No,Like there are lots of lebows out there that turned down 100k for Harvard
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:00 AM",No,lol the people they give money to are people they want to take from Harvard or something
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:00 AM",No,And then the money is free
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:00 AM",No,ya they save it for the Harvard peeps
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:00 AM",No,Right but when that money is turned down
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:00 AM",No,The money is free again
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:00 AM",No,they use it for next year
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:01 AM",No,why give money to someone that would want to come anyway?
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:01 AM",No,They don't have a monopoly on number 4 law school
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:01 AM",No,Chances are they know how to game the admissions game
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:01 AM",No,And I got 50k from the other number 4
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:01 AM",No,And I told them that
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:01 AM",No,And the other number 4 has a cheaper cost of living
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,I don't think they do know the admissions game
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,ya lol so they'll be like go there
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,They'll get someone else with same stats who will gladly go
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,Look into what's been going on in law school admissions for the past few years
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,Haha no that's the thing
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:02 AM",Yes,They clearly took a calculated risk with the knowledge that you might not go there
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,Right but I think they are bad at that
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",Yes,If itÍs not the right place with you after considering cost then donÍt go
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,But someone else will dude
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,Boyu and Brian are making the assumption that the law school admissions market is efficient
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",Yes,If you think itÍs the place you want to go then go
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,Lol Adam there's an overflow of qualified applicants
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",Yes,Whether its efficient or not it doesnÍt really matter
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,Like the previous data that the law schools have about what students will do is describing what Boyu said
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,But that is no longer the case
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,There is no longer an overflow of qualified applicants
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",Yes,Ok but none of that changes your situation
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,Right
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,There's more qualified applicants than spots but not to the same extent that there was previously
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,it's April brah
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,they filled the class already and are getting like stragglers
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,To fill what's left
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,Then it's not filled 
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,Correct but they won't be able to fill it
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,5 spots left and a wait list of like 400 is pretty sizable
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,And their class size will drop like 10-15 kids
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",Yes,Do you want to go to Columbia?
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,It's a thing
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,I did
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,There's a ton of places that do have decreasing enrollment
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,David clearly they knew won
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",Yes,Do you want to now
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,If they matched chicago I would have gone
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,Lol because you're having this dilemma
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,They only win if he goes despite not giving him money
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,they knew they won*
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,Yeah and I'm not going to
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,And then only if that doesn't noticeably affect his future donations as an alum
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,I don't think they lose out of they get another applicant of similar stats
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,in an admissions game
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,without paying money
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,"That's right, but I don't think they are going to be able to do that Boyu"
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,They lose out if David goes on to be a multimillionaire lawyer who donates a lot back to his law school
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,Or an applicant with higher stats
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,lmao they take that chance with every applicant rejected
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,Or accepted
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,he's just a number bro
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,They also definitely lose if they have to accept lower stats or can't fill the class
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,that's law school admissions
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,Numbers are super important for law school 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,Dude
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,It's unbelievable how strongly strangely columbia distributes money
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,The predicted yields are insanely accurate
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,Proof?
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,No Boyu
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,Not at all
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",Yes,"Well David I donÍt think it makes sense to choose not to go out of spite for them not giving you money. If the money significantly affects the decision (because you think youÍll be in too much debt, etc.) or if you really want to go somewhere else then choose somewhere else"
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,proof that every class is nearly the same size
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:07 AM",No,In the past few years they deviate drastically
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",No,And the gpa and lsat does not significantly change
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",No,I'd have to take on 300k debt
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",No,There is no way that's happening
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",Yes,Yeah but you make enough after to pay it off
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",No,debt not worth
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",No,"I think that yields were super accurate, a decade ago "
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",No,Only schools I would do that for are stanford and Harvard
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:08 AM",No,for going to a similar ranked school
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:09 AM",No,My expected earnings from columbia and Chicago or even duke are not that different
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:09 AM",No,Gpa hasn't changed
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:09 AM",No,Lsat has changed drastically over past 5 years
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:09 AM",No,Nyu 5 years ago was as high lsat as yale is today
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:09 AM",Yes,Ok but Chicago only offered you 50k
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:09 AM",Yes,So itÍs not 300k vs nothing
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,Plus cost of living
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",Yes,Which isnÍt that much
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",Yes,Chicago is expensive
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,Columbus's law school went from 1669 to 1547 students
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,18k
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,Over three years
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,That's not perfectly constant
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,Look at the official budgets
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",Yes,The point is if you think youÍll be just as happy or very close to as happy then pick Chicago
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,you don't know if that's them trying to reduce their class size
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,Adam
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,No Boyu
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,It's not
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,You're moving goalposts
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,It's a thing
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:10 AM",No,You first said you knew that yield was accurate because numbers staid the same
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,Class sizes at all but the top top have fallen because there aren't enough qualified applicants
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,Numbers didn't stay the same and so now you're trying to explain that away
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,So chicago is 70k cheaper than columbia
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,Which is like 1.5 years in big law
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,100 isn't even significant for a school of that caliber and size imo
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,100/1547 is significant
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,it's always a function of the applicant pool
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,100 is 10 million in revenue
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,They always take the risk
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",Yes,Right but thats not the only measure David
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,Take what risk? We know it's a function of applicant pool
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,Especially if it's something that always happens
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,"That's literally what we're saying, that applicant pool worsened"
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",Yes,If youÍre going to make 5 mil who cares if it take the 1st 1.5 years to make up the difference
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,or people just went to other schools
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,Did the amount of offers lessen
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,Because there is no guarentee I make 5 mil
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,That's what you need to look at
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,Not class size
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,decrease*
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:13 AM",Yes,Of course not
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,Other people went to other schools is an incredibly relevant point 
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",Yes,But IÍm saying that looking at it in those terms isnÍt necessarily the only way to frame it
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,"That's literally what David is looking at, going to other school because Columbia failed to attract"
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,Dude yield bro
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,If you give the same amount of offers every year
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",Yes,Who gives a shit why Columbia is acting the way it is
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,then you can't tell the level of the applicant pool
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",Yes,That doesnÍt matter
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,based on numbers
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,number of offers
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,or class size
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:15 AM",Yes,This fucking bitch just played boom into onyxia in arena
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:15 AM",Yes,What the actual fuck
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,Boyu can you just fully state your position so that you don't keep moving goalposts
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,And it needs to refute David's argument that Columbia is acting inefficiently
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,"And yes lebow, grad debt can be worth it and probably is for top law"
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,My position is Columbia didn't do anything dumb by not giving David money
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,But Boyu is arguing so poorly that I have to feed the troll 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,that's all I said
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,"Good that was in refute, but why?"
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",Yes,ThatÍs not even my point
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",Yes,My point is no one cares and that the reasoning shouldnÍt affect DavidÍs decision 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,because they can just accept someone who will take the money
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,who doesn't need
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,Whoops
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",Yes,And that this dude is a bitch for having both boom and onyx
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,Yeah that dude is a bitch
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:18 AM",Yes,11-3 :(
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,And yeah the only things that should affect David's reasoning are his internal utility functions 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,The point is that they haven't been able to accept people of the same stats who don't need the money
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:20 AM",No,They've given out more acceptances ( 1251 vs 1175) and had fewer students enroll
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:20 AM",No,Ok so you have no argument
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,1547vs 1669
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,more acceptances
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",Yes,Ok how about this
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",Yes,Boyu comes with us on our trip this summer and fights Adam
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",Yes,Solved that problem
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,you can't tell anything from those numbers
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,No conclusions can be made
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,More acceptances and fewer enroll is strong evidence that they're not getting the same students
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,it could be a variety of things
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,They're trying to keep class size constant and can't
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,"better applicants, other schools are taking them"
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,Worse applicants taking more people
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,It literally could be anything
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,can't tell
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,"You've significantly moved goalposts twice, first by saying yield was ""insanely accurate"" because numbers were constant, then I showed numbers weren't constant. After that you said lowering class size doesn't matter because they could be trying to do that by giving fewer offers, then I showed that they were giving more offers and still having class size decrease"
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,You're not updating your beliefs to match evidence that is contradictory to your previous statements 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,ya because I was wrong 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,Saying the yield was accurate
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,And now I see you can't make statements
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,Period
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,changed my beliefs based on what you showed me
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,neither of us can
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,I'm wrong
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,You're wrong
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,"The opposite of A isn't we don't know anything, it's not A"
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",Yes,Guys
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",Yes,Grand Canyon
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",Yes,Fight
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:25 AM",Yes,Loser falls into the ravine
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,Nah dude
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,We can't make any conclusions based on a single schools day at
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,Data
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,I'm scared of heights
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,admissions is a mixed web of shit
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,We're only talking about a single school
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,you can't make conclusions on a single school
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,Other schools admissions affect a single school it's a confounded variable
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,Especially if it's so variable like you say
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,But that's the point
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:28 AM",No,"Or at least the statement ""other schools are playing the game better than Columbia"" still falls under the umbrella of ""Columbia could play the game better"""
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,What does Columbia lose from not giving David money?
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,Tuition+ alumni donations+ chance of good publicity/prestige 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,(Assuming he nor anyone else fills that spot)
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,Neither he*
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,Donations is never a given
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,Things don't need to be guarenteed to be considered
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,All 3 of those can be offered
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,By another person
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,what does he offer that another applicant doesn't
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,It could be literally nothing (not saying it is/no offense David) but at some level they still need to just fill seats
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,"He doesn't have to be the best, or even better than average, he just needs to be a marginal benefit "
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:32 AM",No,Yeah I think they aren't going to fill seats
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:32 AM",No,And if they do they will drop their stats
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:32 AM",No,I don't drop their stats
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:32 AM",No,You don't raise them either
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:32 AM",No,a 180 would help
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",Yes,Stop being a dick Boyu
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,and that's where the money goes
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Nobody is saying it wouldn't
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,That's exogenous to the reasons I stated
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",Yes,Clearly they had a reason to want David in their class
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,"If they drop their stats, chicago, who is playing the game better, will beat columbia"
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Ya I'm just talking about money tho 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Using s
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Top schools no longer need to compete over only top applicants. They need to compete over average applicants
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Using some money just to fill seats is reasonable 
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,(Average for them)
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,If otherwise you wouldn't fill seats
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,"It's no longer a pure race to the top, they actually have to worry about slipping"
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,Because there aren't enough qualified applicants to fill seats at top schools
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,That's why so many of them started offering money to so many more candidates in recent years
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:36 AM",No,Then Adam explain why they didn't offer him money
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:38 AM",No,Because they acted inefficiently 
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:38 AM",Yes,Lol Boyu thats the action theyÍre criticizing 
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:39 AM",No,Only columbia is acting like idiots
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:39 AM",Yes,You canÍt use that to support your argument
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:39 AM",No,It makes no sense to me that because they are desperate to fill a class they're going to give applicants that they're accepting at the end of a cycle so most likely off a wait list
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:39 AM",No,Some money to go there
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:39 AM",No,Because they still make a profit off of me
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:39 AM",No,If they give me mowny
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:40 AM",No,Actions should be decided based on if marginal benefit outweighs marginal cost
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:40 AM",No,Otherwise you're acting inefficiently 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:40 AM",No,is it black and white that every student is a positive profit
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:40 AM",No,Marginal cost can and should include opportunity cost
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:40 AM",No,I'm not really sure where the costs are associated with students
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,because I remember all the Ivy leagues operate at a loss
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,With their students 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,"You don't need to be able to certainly evaluate everyone, you look at weighted average"
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,for undergrad
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,They say that but then have gigantic endowments
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",Yes,Harvard tried to claim they lose many on every student
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,So they're clearly playing around with accounting
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",Yes,Even if they were paying full price
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",Yes,(not including donations after graduation)
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,And discounting sources of revenue
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:41 AM",No,professor salaries 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:42 AM",No,Go up lol
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:42 AM",No,Gotta pay for that shit
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:42 AM",No,Not in law school
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:42 AM",No,and staff
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:42 AM",No,They've actually frozen or seen contracting pressure 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:44 AM",No,"Discounting alumni donations completely is completely idiotic given the size that they are, you can definitely include risk factors and discount due to it being out in the future but it has to come into the equation somehow"
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:45 AM",No,Columbia also low balls their cost of living
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:45 AM",Yes,I think the actual argument was tuition doesnÍt cover all the costs
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:45 AM",No,Oh that might be valid 
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:45 AM",No,I doubt it's valid
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:45 AM",No,I've heard it stated for undergrad a number of times
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:45 AM",No,Unless they include crazy research PhDs are doing under cost for undergrads
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,Lol I believe it
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,"Then probs, because Harvard does tons of reseach, but they get grants for that"
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,I don't think they include that but I do think they include a lot of international initiatives and costs of new building
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,Tuition costs are insane
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,They're over 10k higher than when we started
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:47 AM",No,It's a bubble because the government guarentees loans
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:47 AM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:47 AM",No,So universities can keep charging higher prices
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:47 AM",No,truuuuuuu
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:47 AM",No,We need to stop having idiots in the White House who don't know math guiding loan policies
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:48 AM",No,Obama and bush made the same mistake about making money free for everybody
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:48 AM",No,*makig money accessible
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:48 AM",No,"There's also this super strong ideology about giving everyone ""accesss"" to loans so that they have ""access"" to college"
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:48 AM",No,Thabks Obama
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:49 AM",No,Which we basically just need to admit doesn't work and stop guaranteeing loans 
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:49 AM",No,And then tuition will fall again
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:49 AM",No,It's not like college degrees guarantee good jobs anymore 
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:49 AM",No,I really should have cancelled my lsat when I knew I messed it up
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,Dudeeee
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,Ubgot into great schools
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,lol
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,For lots of money
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,Idk sometimes those gut feelings can be misleading
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,You're not considering the risk of scoring the same or lower
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,I almost cancelled my bio sat 2 
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,The 2nd time
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,My range was 169-178
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:51 AM",No,I thought I scored a 173
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:51 AM",No,no guarantee you would have done better or worse
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:51 AM",No,So I didn't cancel
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:52 AM",No,But it turns out I made one more mistake than I expected and the curve was 1 harsher than I expected
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:52 AM",No,So it was a 171. Still in my range
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:52 AM",No,But the dif between a 175 or so and a 171 
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:53 AM",Yes,I think youÍre overrating how much lsat hurt you and underrating gpa
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,"Is acceptance to Harvard. 30k at Mich, 30k at duke, 20k at chicago"
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,I think you didn't do the relevant research bri
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,It's all on law school numbers
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,You can click on dots with people with different stats and see what money they got where
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:34 PM",Yes,IÍm getting 43.1% for the riddler
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:35 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:39 PM",No,Well that's in the range between 1/2 and 1/3
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,What does h=[] do and h.append(0) do?
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:42 PM",Yes,the first makes an empty array and the second fills it with zeroes
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:43 PM",No,Oh makes sense
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:43 PM",Yes,i didnÍt want to deal with edge cases so originally i made it go to houses +2 and set the random integer between 2 and houses+1 but for some reason i was still getting out of bounds errors
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:43 PM",Yes,so i just made it plus 10
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:43 PM",No,Yeah boundary cases should go away as it gets infinitely large
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:44 PM",Yes,i donÍt get why i get boundary cases with +2
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:44 PM",Yes,but whatever
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:44 PM",No,Your algo for populating the houses seem wildly inefficient but not necessarily wrong
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:44 PM",Yes,haha what else could you do
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:45 PM",No,Something where you have an array of possible locations and you reduce it whenever a location does get populated
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:45 PM",Yes,originally i was going to go through the entire array after every single house was populated and check if all houses were populated or not
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:45 PM",Yes,yeah but i donÍt know how to do a random integer other than certain numbers
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:45 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:45 PM",No,I'm not sure how to immediately improve on it either
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:46 PM",No,Well you could have An  array of positions and do something with taking a random position between 1 and the length of the array
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:47 PM",Yes,Eh
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:47 PM",Yes,Seems like a lot of effort
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,And intelligently remove available positions when one gets populated
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,It's probably more lines of code
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:47 PM",Yes,IÍm just gonna assume if I do a lot more trials than houses it will get filled up
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,Probably accurate
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,Definitely inefficient
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:48 PM",Yes,Well yeah
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,Dunno how you're planning on getting hired as a hearthstone developer after you drop out of law school with a mindset like that
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:49 PM",Yes,lol i had to look up how to make an array
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:49 PM",Yes,donÍt think IÍm getting hired for that any time soon
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:50 PM",No,Just tell them you got into Harvard law but would rather play hearthstone all day
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:51 PM",Yes,k ill try it
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:54 PM",No,I feel like you're just saying that
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:58 PM",Yes,What does this mean
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:58 PM",Yes,Trade failed - No margin available
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:59 PM",Yes,I think these trades are failing because I just hit show max and tried to buy the max number of shares
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 3:59 PM",Yes,"But by the time the market opened, it cost more than $1mil for the number of shares"
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,That would make sense 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,Idk the actual answer tho
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 4:17 PM",Yes,After careful analysis itÍs actually 43.2%
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:07 PM",No,Yo is that girl gonna be around Adam?
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:07 PM",No,the tufts one
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:08 PM",No,who gets smashed
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:17 PM",No,Kira?
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:18 PM",No,Ya
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:18 PM",No,I know she's going off to grad school at some point but idk when
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:18 PM",No,Id come and tap that
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:18 PM",No,Haven't touched vag in two months
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:19 PM",No,I don't even care LoL
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:19 PM",No,Oh Brian she's another example of one of the people in TS that's super social and was put in optima 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:19 PM",No,Optime
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:20 PM",No,lol she's super social?
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:20 PM",No,She's a math major
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:20 PM",No,She hangs out with Sam a lot at least
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:20 PM",No,And gets around
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:20 PM",No,Sounds like Emma
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:20 PM",No,LOL
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:20 PM",No,She seems a lot smarter and a lot saner
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:21 PM",Yes,Are you talking about the road trip Boyu?
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:21 PM",No,How dtf is she
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:21 PM",Yes,Because I was assuming you werenÍt coming
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:21 PM",No,I can maybe fly out to Wisconsin
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:21 PM",No,2 weeks too long
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:21 PM",Yes,Ok well weÍre only gonna be in Madison 2 nights 1 day
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:22 PM",No,Send me the it's weary
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:22 PM",No,I ternary
18605603559,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:22 PM",No,lol
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:22 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:24 PM",No,"You also could just come out another time, although my summers filling up with trips pretty quick"
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:54 PM",Yes,Planning out the first couple days of this trip
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:54 PM",Yes,ItÍs crazy how much time driving takes up
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 7:54 PM",Yes,ItÍs gonna be hard to do much hiking if weÍre driving 7 + hours 
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:04 PM",No,Yeah funny how that works when you're trying to do a round trip around the country
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:04 PM",Yes,The part youÍll be joining us for will be sick though
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:04 PM",Yes,When weÍre driving only a couple hours per day
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Yeah I saw
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Thanks
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:06 PM",Yes,Also some of these parks take up like multiple states
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,Yeah some parks are really big
18609676168,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,Denali park in Alaska is the size of Massachusetts 
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 8:45 PM",Yes,I think I'm gonna add an extra day and start the trip July 7 to break up some driving unless you have an objection David 
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 9:00 PM",No,I'm down
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 9:01 PM",No,We can even start it earlier
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 9:01 PM",Yes,Ok IÍll see it
18609894948,"Apr 22, 2016, 9:02 PM",Yes,"The thing is, I donÍt know how much we can add stops on the trip because I donÍt know how many national parks there are at places so it would be more of adding a day to rest/explore a park after a long day of driving"
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 9:02 PM",No,K
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 9:02 PM",No,Zion baby

18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 9:13 PM",No,Lol
18607168967,"Apr 22, 2016, 10:59 PM",No,Zuck is love Zuck is life
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,Random.choice pulls abandon element from an array
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 11:51 AM",Yes,seems like a lot of effort
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 11:51 AM",No,Just populate the house array with your counter and then depopulate with random.choice and also check for next door houses whenever you depopulate 
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,My code is better than your code
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 12:58 PM",No,I also got the casino game one ( it was easy)
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,Also you know the one with the cutoff and random game show from 0 to 1?
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 3:04 PM",No,I think I wrote code that should get it but it won't converge and stay stable
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 3:07 PM",No,
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 3:12 PM",No,
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 3:07 PM",No,
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:17 PM",Yes,Your code for the houses game looks better than mine
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:17 PM",Yes,Why do you need the number of trials to be different from the number of houses?
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:19 PM",Yes,In other news I went hiking today and got my car stuck on the side of the road
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:19 PM",Yes,The front wheels were in mud and itÍs front wheel drive so they were just spinning
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:19 PM",Yes,I think we should use DavidÍs car for the road trip
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:20 PM",No,My parents already told me no because they think my car is too old for a big road trip (2007)
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:20 PM",Yes,Your car is 4 wheel drive and an suv 
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:21 PM",Yes,ItÍs much better than mine
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:21 PM",No,I agree that it is 4 wheel drive and an suv
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:22 PM",No,It also gets less than 20 mpg and had recent maitenance
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:22 PM",No,This is a conversation that we need to have but not right now
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:23 PM",No,Also we need an agreement for people beforehand about how we split any car maitenance bills that are required for whatever car we take
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:23 PM",No,A long road trip won't be good for any car and may cause damage
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:24 PM",No,No reason that whole risk should go to the owner of the car
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:25 PM",Yes,I would think weÍd just look at cost/mile that is reimbursed and use that to figure it out
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:30 PM",No,?
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:30 PM",Yes,like what triple a says it costs/mile 
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:30 PM",Yes,or whoever
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,What if the car breaks down?
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,You think it shouldn't be split evenly?
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:32 PM",Yes,Well I mean assuming there arenÍt issues like that
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:32 PM",Yes,Obviously then weÍd have to figure shit out
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 4:32 PM",Yes,But in terms of reimbursing for additional costs than gas even if there arenÍt complicating issues
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:37 PM",No,Word
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:37 PM",No,Cars have limited spans
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:37 PM",Yes,Yeah
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:37 PM",Yes,I mean regardless of risk with cars I think itÍs worth it to do the trip
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:37 PM",Yes,ItÍs not a chance weÍre gonna have again
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:38 PM",Yes,If we want to take my car so be it but there are risks with that
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:39 PM",Yes,My car has the remainder of a 10 year/100k mile warranty on it
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 5:39 PM",Yes,And is at 44k miles right now
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:25 PM",No,The federal mileage reimbursement rate is something like 54 cents per mile which is supposed to factor in degradation of the car
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:28 PM",Yes,That seems high
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:29 PM",Yes,"Like my car cost 12k to buy, I donÍt think it can cost 3k for 6000 miles"
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:29 PM",No,"I think the idea is if you got paid that much on an average car from the time you started driving it until when you stopped it would include all gas, repairs and the purchasing price of the car"
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:30 PM",Yes,Gas will only be $600 though
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:30 PM",Yes,20 miles/gallon * $2/gallon
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:31 PM",Yes,except do the conversions correctly
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:38 PM",No,Yeah that does seem a bit high still
18609676168,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:38 PM",No,2400 is enough for 2+ repairs 
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:39 PM",No,That's for business
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:39 PM",No,For charity it's 14 cents
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:40 PM",No,https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/2016-Standard-Mileage-Rates-for-Business-Medical-and-Moving-Announced
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:40 PM",No,So there is some opprotunity cost that is most of the price that we don't understand
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:41 PM",No,I was thinking $100-200 would be fair
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:41 PM",No,But maybe it's my like 6000/2/10
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:41 PM",No,So like 300-400
18609894948,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:41 PM",Yes,In other news I think weÍre gonna stay with Arnav in Dallas to break up the 12 hour day David
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,K
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,I'll look at the route again
18607168967,"Apr 23, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,And see if I know anybody along the way
18609676168,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Finally took my bike out for a legit spin
18609676168,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,I think I need to lower the seat 
18607168967,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,Is erectile dysfunction real?
18607168967,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,Or do men just not want to have sex with old women
18609894948,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:43 PM",Yes,pretty sure its real dude
18605603559,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,Lol wtf

18605603559,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Apr 24, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,ED is really

18607168967,"Apr 24, 2016, 1:02 PM",No,Lebow can you email my mom the itinerary? Figtree11@comcast.net
18609676168,"Apr 24, 2016, 4:14 PM",No,Also lebow the trials parameter was for an outer loop
18609676168,"Apr 24, 2016, 4:14 PM",No,So that you can do 1000 trials of a millennial houses instead of a bill in houses
18609676168,"Apr 24, 2016, 4:14 PM",No,Billion
18609894948,"Apr 24, 2016, 4:14 PM",Yes,word

18609894948,"Apr 24, 2016, 4:18 PM",Yes,This was after some dude pulled my car out of the mud for me

18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:02 PM",No,Only stanford
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:02 PM",No, But I'm not going to those schools 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:03 PM",No,And stanford is ranked the same as Harvard
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:03 PM",No,And Brian liked Harvard
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:03 PM",No,(Also I may have invented fb)

18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:04 PM",Yes,But I figure I should wait and hear about loans before officially accepting
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:04 PM",No,I think you have to give them a kidney as collateral
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:05 PM",No,But it's ok because they give you aesthetics for the first hour of the operation
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:06 PM",No,Nah it's just like 1000 deposit 
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:06 PM",Yes,$0 deposit

18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,Sounds like they're desperate for people to enroll
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,Probably should look for a less desperate school
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:34 PM",No,Finally ran into a Harvard kid

18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:37 PM",No,(No tufts. I've only met 1 tufts person and that was at michigan)
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:37 PM",No,Yeah I don't think we send a ton to law school for whatever reason
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:38 PM",No,Or to necessarily great ones
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,I haven't met any smith

18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 2:22 PM",No,What're you going to tell them?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 2:30 PM",No,They basically had me talk to somebody at the bottom of the power ladder and she said it was over
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 2:30 PM",No,I'm so pissed
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 2:43 PM",No,I hate columbia so much
18605603559,"Apr 25, 2016, 2:44 PM",No,Lol bro at least they let you in!!
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:06 PM",No,"Met a guy who had a 3.78, 178 from wisconsin that didn't get into Harvard and didn't get money at Columbia"
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:07 PM",No,I am no longer so sure about how by the numbers columbia is
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:49 PM",No,Called warriors would get the record but not win the title
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:51 PM",No,178 is pretty high 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,It's not low
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,Maybe he was a dick 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,He didn't have to interview
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,Could theoretically come out in essay 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,His essay must have been terrible
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,Like straight up not English
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,Or like fuck you eat shit
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:57 PM",No,Columbia definitely had the most impressive students
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:57 PM",No,Some of my favorite kids from duke were there
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,"(That's actually the local cheer at the football games here, one half yells eat shit to the other team who responds with fuck you)"
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,Haha that's so funny
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,And that's kind of cool to meet up again
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,Just make Jessica email me
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,Stupid bitch is playing hard 2 g3t
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:59 PM",No,I think literally everybody at this columbia day was on the waitlist at Harvard
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:59 PM",No,Also is Harvard even better than columbia
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:59 PM",No,Is columbia even better than chicagoV
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 7:59 PM",No,Are any of these schools better?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:00 PM",No,Why are all the Ivies at Columbia and not chicago?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:00 PM",No,Why is nyc so awesome
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:00 PM",No,Why is it so expensive?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:00 PM",No,"Also, I'm really unhealthy when I visit there"
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,"Is that just because I'm visiting, or is it too hard for me to be helathy in NYC so I shouldn't go there?"
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,Probably some of both
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,I think a lot of parts of the NYC lifestyle are just inherently unhealthy 
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,But whenever you go to visit somewhere you're not thinking as much about long term consequences 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:02 PM",No,Can Lebow just enroll at both places and I pretend to be himat columbia?
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:02 PM",No,Um
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:02 PM",No,I think that's up to the two of you
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:02 PM",No,Seems viable
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:02 PM",No,Seems weir
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:02 PM",No,Weird
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:02 PM",No,100k is a lot of money
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,You'd still have to pay to be enrolled
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,If you have two people enrolled you have two tuitions 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,Yeah but you don't have to pay all the money columbia wants
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,I just don't get it
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,Columbia isn't that good
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,Why won't they give me money?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,Or are they that good?
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,They're going to be a lot of people's top choice after hsy
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,A lot of people want to live and work in NYC 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,And everybody there was rejected at those places
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,But chicago is just as good if not better
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Placement wise
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:07 PM",No,And cost of living is cheaper
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:07 PM",No,I could even see some people choosing Columbia over Stanford if they had very strong east coast ties 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:07 PM",No,And columbia collects on housing at Columbia
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:07 PM",No,And their tuition is highest
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:07 PM",No,They fuck toy from all ends
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:08 PM",No,I think that overall their is a very strong appeal to living in NYC for whatever reasons and basically everyone who lives there pays that price 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:08 PM",No,But you pay it to nyc
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:08 PM",No,Why do you have to pay it to columbia too?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,Columbia is a piece of shit
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,They are such assholes
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,"Cause you didn't fully pay it to NYC, because part of the rent is paid to people who control who can live there "
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,Right so their tuition is higher
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,I get it
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,But why won't they match the scholarship?
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,Oh I think this particular case is a market inefficiency
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,It's a dif of 66k over 3 years
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,Maybe more like 75k
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,Which I've already argued extensively 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,It's because chicago gives mini scholarships and columbia doesn't
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,But nyu does
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:11 PM",No,But nyu didn't let me in
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:11 PM",No,The bastards
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:11 PM",No,"Columbia only gives like 1/4, 1/2, and full"
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:11 PM",No,My friend Josh's brother went to nyu
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:11 PM",No,Yeah?
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,Now I think he's an A3 looking to lateral to another big law firm
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,Looking to move to a big one in California I think
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,What firm is he at?
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,I don't know
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,Columbia kids had social skills
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,Chicago kids don't
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:13 PM",No,And I wasn't the only person to realize that
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:13 PM",No,But does that mean I will kill it at chicago? They'll be like this kid isn't autistic
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:13 PM",No,Apperantly he's making 185 now but all the other associates at that firm are either moving to in house council or otherwise leaving so he's looking to jump
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:13 PM",No,"He's not the coolest guy ever, but he's not autistic"
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:13 PM",No,Nah probably just means you'll become awkward 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:13 PM",No,That sucks
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:14 PM",No,There is no best choice here
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:14 PM",No,Duke?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:14 PM",No,But duke just isn't as good
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:15 PM",No,Also Columbia and chicagos business schools are definitely better than Michigan and dukes 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:15 PM",No,Really? Columbia has a good b school?
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:15 PM",No,"Yeah, it's in that m7 tier "
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:15 PM",Yes,Michigan has a great business school
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:16 PM",No,It has a really famous value investing course
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:16 PM",No,It's in the immediate next tier 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:16 PM",No,Lebow tell columbia to give me your money
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:16 PM",No,You lose nothing
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:16 PM",No,Michigan and fuqua are both really strong but they're more like t15 strong than t9
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:21 PM",No,Columbia can't be worth full boat
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:22 PM",No,It's buying a car once a year and pushing it off a cliff for 10 years
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:22 PM",No,Whereas duke is buying a car and pushing it off a cliff every other year for 10 years
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,Way fewer demolished cars at duke
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,Tuition at law school has gone up 10k per year at all the law achools
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,In the last 5 years
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,That's so much haha
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,Cost of attendance at Columbia will be like 305k 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,Salary has not risen
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,It's maybe even taken a dive
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,Yeah so fucked
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,What id happenings
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:34 PM",No,Who chooses columbia?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:34 PM",No,Is it a good choice in the long run?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:35 PM",No,Why are all of these places so expensive?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:40 PM",No,Fuckfuckfuck
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:52 PM",No,I met two foreign math postdocs at the bar
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 8:52 PM",No,Fuck I wish I could math
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,Math is cool
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,And you don't have to pay to go to math grad school 
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,And then you definitely get a good job afterwards
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:06 PM",No,Hmm you probably do
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:06 PM",No,Do a mah PHD at Princeton and have decent social skills
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:06 PM",No,Consultancies would probably eat their own shit to get yu
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:07 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:07 PM",No,Or is that wrong?
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:07 PM",No,It'd probably be groups more specialized than general management consulting
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:07 PM",No,Maybe a Phd in stem is the way to go
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:08 PM",No,No debt
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:08 PM",No,Potentially dope job prospects
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:08 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:08 PM",No,At least I tried for it
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:08 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:09 PM",No,Maybe I should have thrown an application to columbia there too
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:12 PM",No,I feel like a hard applied math Phd was the way to go
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:12 PM",Yes,sounds awful
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:13 PM",No,You were the closest to studying that
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:13 PM",No,How do you feel about being done with physics?
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:13 PM",Yes,physics is real though
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:13 PM",Yes,math is fake
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:13 PM",No,Both are fake
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,physics does real experiments 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:14 PM",No,Physics is literally just math
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:14 PM",No,Anyways
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:14 PM",No,Do you miss physics?
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,not really
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:14 PM",No,How did you choose to study it?
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,math does theoretical bullshit
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:15 PM",Yes,i just took physics classes freshman year because they seemed cool and then when i switched out of b school it seemed like the thing to do
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,Seems legit
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,Ever consider a masters or Phd?
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:16 PM",Yes,no
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:16 PM",Yes,maybe in engineering
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,Why?
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:16 PM",Yes,not in physics
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,Also columbia seems so chill because you just sign up for a job
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:17 PM",Yes,same with everywhere
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,You just sign up for a job in nyc
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,Making bank
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,And working 1 billion hours
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,its probably easier to get an nyc job
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,And it seems impossible to get a clerkship
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,but IÍm sure you could do the same thing in chicago
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,at chicago
18609894948,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,i bet you could get 1
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,Yeah but chicago sucks
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:19 PM",No,Grad degrees in stem are hard
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:19 PM",No,Nah
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,Also I can't tell if nyc is good or bad
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,There's no way non stem degrees are as mentally difficult 
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,Like stem was just harder than not stem
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Eh. I'm sure that most aren't
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,But I bet some non stem things are just as hard
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Non stem can only be more volume 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Like philosophy that is math
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Is hard
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Philosophy is an outlier

18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:23 PM",No,"Sociology, psychology, history aren't close to Chem, math or physics"
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,Psych can be
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,That uses the scientific method
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,Only if they're being more rigorous than normal
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,Good psych (if it exists) is legit
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,No
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,Have you ever taken a real psych class or read a psych paper?
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,It's pure scientific method
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,Yeah I've read some
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,A lot make basic logic fallacies
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:25 PM",No,Not in peer reviewed journals
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:26 PM",No,Maybe I saw a particularly flawed sample but
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,Chemistry is just engineering
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,Phsycian is just math
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,Bio an psychology are pretty much the same
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,It's just easier to show psych is bullshit
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,It's a lot easier
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,Same boat as econ
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,Applicstion of the scientific I method to something that is just really hard to study
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,Yeah econ/psych call themselves social sciences 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,So should bio
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Bio is a life science
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,But breaks the atomic unit of creature
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Yeah life sciences are bsIsh
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,Columbia and chicago are just better than mich and duke
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,Still their applicability is so high
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:32 PM",No,And yeah that's basically just in line with rating tiers
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,The tiers are real
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,I wish I got to visit tier 1 to see what they are like
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,There's a scene in suits where he visits Harvard
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,Lebow left columbia unimpressed

18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 10:01 PM",No,I don't want to go a tier down

18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,Blargh I hate columbia
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,I would go

18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,"Also, I should never drink"
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,Harvard/Yale/Stanford wouldn't have given you money and the post graduation career stats are pretty similar
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,That's 100% true
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,I'm not sure why I put the t3 on a peds ste
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,When columbia has always always always been 4
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:43 PM",No,Like they might be better but not by leaps and bounds 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:44 PM",No,Honestly they may not even be better than columbia when it comes to firm placement
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,I think it's a name thing(?)
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,But most people think columbia is a good name
18609676168,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,Yeah 
18607168967,"Apr 25, 2016, 11:47 PM",No,But idk
18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:08 AM",No,You know how I become a huge(r) asshole when I drink and I say really regrettable things? There is no way I can do that in professional school
18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:09 AM",No,"I don't know if that changes what school I should go to, but it's really true"
18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:16 AM",No,Also why is need based aid a thing in professional school? Most kids are taking on the debt themselves. Makes no sense 
18605603559,"Apr 26, 2016, 8:40 AM",No,Ya dude
18605603559,"Apr 26, 2016, 8:40 AM",No,Your days of blacking out are over

18609676168,"Apr 26, 2016, 10:15 AM",No,Need based aid kind of makes sense if you're supporting someone else

18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 12:34 PM",No,Tbp?

18609676168,"Apr 26, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,But yeah nerd advisor
18609676168,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,Chobani gave 10% of its stock to its employees

18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,Straight up
18609676168,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:07 PM",No,"Still, I think that's like a 150k avg bonus to each employee"
18609894948,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:11 PM",Yes,lol the guy allergic to milk hates yogurt 
18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:16 PM",No,It's only chobani that makes me nauseous 
18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 3:16 PM",No,I can't be within 10 feet of it
18607168967,"Apr 26, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,Blargh they don't think it will be brokered
18607168967,"Apr 27, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,So it seems that the t3 are a thing
18607168967,"Apr 27, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,The t14 are a hint
18607168967,"Apr 27, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,*thing
18607168967,"Apr 27, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,But it is unclear whether the t6 is a thing
18605603559,"Apr 27, 2016, 3:09 PM",No,David are you in weha anymore
18605603559,"Apr 27, 2016, 3:09 PM",No,Haven't seen you in a while

18607168967,"Apr 27, 2016, 5:32 PM",No,Haha maybe I won't go there
18609676168,"Apr 27, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,So when do you have to decide by?
18607168967,"Apr 27, 2016, 6:03 PM",No,Friday

18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 4:37 PM",No,They were clearly waiting for you to accept Harvard
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 4:41 PM",No,"Well you know what they say, Stanford might call itself the Harvard of the east, but Harvard doesn't need to compare itself to other schools to establish validity "
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 4:42 PM",No,No Harvard is the anti-brown
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 4:42 PM",No,They establish how good they are by comparing themselves to how bad brown is
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 4:42 PM",No,(But actually that's probably columbia/princeton)
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,Lol I wasn't being serious
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,Although I have heard that statement made by someone who I think was being serious
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 6:54 PM",No,I'm going to go to uconn law next year
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 6:54 PM",No,But seriously should I go to washu law for free?
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:26 PM",No,How did you feel about washu vs Michigan 
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:27 PM",No, I didn't check the washu law school while there
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:28 PM",Yes,donÍt go to wash
18605603559,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:29 PM",No,Take dat debt
18605603559,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:29 PM",No,And go to Columbia

18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:29 PM",Yes,Thanks man
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:31 PM",Yes,Or chicago 
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:31 PM",Yes,you have tons of good options
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:32 PM",No,What would you do bri?
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:32 PM",Yes,I would probably be between Michigan and Columbia
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:32 PM",No,Interesting
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:32 PM",Yes,But I also have a sister at Michigan
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:32 PM",No,Why?
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",Yes,Actually I need to think
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",Yes,You got money at Chicago but not Columbia>
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",Yes,?
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",No,I asked columbia for money twice
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",No,They told me no three times
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",No,Lol
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",Yes,I know absolutely nothing about Chicago and Duke
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:33 PM",Yes,"Michigan is gorgeous, a great name, and would be a blast for 3 years"
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:34 PM",Yes,Columbia would be less fun for me (maybe better for you because new york) and I think sounds the best of all the schools you got into
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:34 PM",Yes,Michigan is cheaper
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:34 PM",Yes,Michigan is far away
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:35 PM",Yes,Columbia has more of the type of people youÍd want to be around I think
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:36 PM",No,Yeah I liked the columbia kids the most
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:36 PM",Yes,What do you guys think Adam/Boyu
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:36 PM",No,By far
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:36 PM",No,And all of my favorite kids from the other visits were at the columbia visit
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:37 PM",Yes,If you see yourself at a corporate job or similar where money wonÍt be an obstacle I think you should choose Columbia
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:37 PM",Yes,However personally I think I would choose Michigan
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:38 PM",Yes,Also though if you want to work in New York you pretty much get that guaranteed at Columbia
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,I've talked with David for a while but I think Chicago first for the prestige/academics:cost ratio
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,And probs Michigan second as it would probs be a lot of fun and still set you up very well
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:48 PM",Yes,I donÍt see the advantage of Chicago over Columbia 
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:48 PM",Yes,It seems to me theyÍre both a lot of debt and Columbia has way more ties to NYC which I imagine is a place he wants to be
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:49 PM",No,68 vs 90 a year is meaningful
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:51 PM",No,And the employment/job statistics looked pretty similar for both of those schools but a bit different for mich
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,I also happen to like Chicago a lot more than NYC so I'm definitely biased
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,Uchicago is 35 min south of Chicago proper
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,It's not in chicago
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,I've considered that and weight it the same as tufts:Boston
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:55 PM",Yes,Is their law campus not on their undergrad campus?
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,It is
18609676168,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,Which was 30-45 depending on where on tufts you were/how bad the t stop was
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,Well like a 10 min walk
18609894948,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:55 PM",Yes,I thought that was like in the city
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,No and the young people live 20 min both of downtown
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,So uchicago is 50 min from the young people
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,"Columbia is 50 min from brooklyn, but there are young people in Manhattan and columbia is in the city"

18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 8:00 PM",No,So like 3 that would be interested in having anything to do with me
18607168967,"Apr 28, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,"But it's not really a women thing, it's more of a friend's thing I guess"

18609894948,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:42 AM",Yes,And if you play forgotten torch without the discount the torch gets the discount
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:48 AM",No,"Big law is 160, 170, 185, 210, 230, 250"

18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:50 AM",No,Note that most people leave after 2 years
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:51 AM",No,So the columbia debt would only take 5 years to pay back
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:51 AM",No,If you can stomach big law for that log
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:52 AM",No,Are those top bucket bonuses or avg?
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:52 AM",No,Top bucket

18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 12:59 AM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:00 AM",No,Also marginal debt increase matters kind of a lot because that additional money will be the last you pay off so it accumulates interest for the longest
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:00 AM",No,"If you save half the disposable income, it'll take 7 years to pay off the debt"
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:00 AM",No,If I have 250 debt at 7% interest
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:00 AM",No,It'll take a long fucking time
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:01 AM",No,I mean you'll be able to refinance down after you graduate 
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:01 AM",No,As soon as you get a job start looking into refinancing
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:01 AM",No,What sort of interest do you think?
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:01 AM",No,Like my original loan was from Sofi and then they bought themselves out to refinance after I got a job 
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:02 AM",No,That's nice of them
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:02 AM",No,Why would they do that?
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:02 AM",No,Went from ~6.5 to 4.65 for my undergrad debt
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:02 AM",No,"Competitive market, if they don't someone else will "
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:02 AM",No,8 years to pay off in big law
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:03 AM",No,Probs 20 in house
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:03 AM",No,(Unless you spend more than half of disposable income on it)

18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:05 AM",No,What interest rate do you think I can get?
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:07 AM",No,Not really sure but I'd guess somewhere between 3-5 over LIBOR
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:07 AM",No,What's libor?
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:07 AM",No,London interest something something something
18609894948,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:08 AM",Yes,libor is the dumbest shit ever
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:08 AM",No,It's some interest rate that's used for inter bank loans in London
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:08 AM",No,That's also the basis of educational loans in the US for some reason
18609894948,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:08 AM",Yes,its bankers making fraudulent deals
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:08 AM",No,Makes sense
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:08 AM",No,What's it around now?
18609894948,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:09 AM",Yes,there have been a million cases of bankers making deals to change rates for each other
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:09 AM",No,I think it's still low
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:10 AM",No,Like around 1%
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:10 AM",No,So I could conceivable get 5-7
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:10 AM",No,If you're not going to manipulate something why go into finance
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:10 AM",No,That would be my guess
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:10 AM",No,Oh 4-6
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:10 AM",No,Columbia is doable
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:10 AM",No,Yeah somewhere around there
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:11 AM",No,Think I should do it? Or duke and be free 3 years earlier?
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:12 AM",No,I've been leaning towards mich for the past couple hours
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:13 AM",No,Why mich over duke?
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:13 AM",No,Honestly probably for pretty subjective reasons
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:14 AM",No,Like what?
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:14 AM",No,I think my moms opinion on Duke mostly being a southern school weighed kind of heavily and my roomates just love Michigan and I was out with them tonight
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:15 AM",No,People love michigan
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:15 AM",No,One of them didn't even go there but still absolutely loves it
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:15 AM",No,Duke has an a from students and an a from alums

18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:16 AM",No,(He did grow up in Ann Arbor tho)

18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:16 AM",No,Only issue is if you don't like the school they'll end up lynching you to keep their avg up
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:18 AM",No,9 years to pay back columbia going in house after 2 years
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:19 AM",No,Still 4 with duke/mich
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:20 AM",No,"Honestly if you can get a good refinancing deal and your cash flow is fine, total payback time doesn't matter *that much*"
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:20 AM",No,Like as long as you're able to live the lifestyle you want and still save enough for retirement
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:20 AM",No,It's whether you can quit
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:20 AM",No,Especially if you can get the interest rate below market return or ideally closeish to inflation rate
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:20 AM",No, Yeah being able to quit is big
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:21 AM",No,I did this with 5% interest
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:21 AM",No,That's probs a good place to start
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:21 AM",No,Columbia in house I have 320 saved and 0 debt after 10 years
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:22 AM",No,Duke I am debt free and have 110 saved after 4 years
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:22 AM",No,Then I can retire and write a novel
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:22 AM",No,And then be homeless in 4 more years
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:23 AM",No,Wait you're 320 in the bank and debt free after 10 years of in house after Columbia?

18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:24 AM",No,Maybe should go down to 175
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:24 AM",No,Dunno
18609676168,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:25 AM",No,"You could do a couple of scenarios where you change plateau salary, loan interest, and amount saved/living expenses to gauge sensitivity "
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:25 AM",No,"If it's 175, not 210, I never get out of debt for columbia"
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:25 AM",No,Ever
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:25 AM",No,Haha

18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:29 AM",No,(But obvs I could spend savings on debt if I wanted to get out earlier)
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 1:31 AM",No,The kids at Columbia were great though
18607168967,"Apr 29, 2016, 2:00 AM",No,I matched with 18 girls on tinder at mich

18609894948,"May 1, 2016, 10:20 AM",Yes,Leicester City is tied with Manchester United right now. If they win they will clinch the title in probably the most improbable story in modern sports history
18607168967,"May 1, 2016, 10:20 AM",No,What's the story
18609894948,"May 1, 2016, 10:22 AM",Yes,"Only 4 teams ever win the premier league title (ManU, Chelsea, Asenal, and Man City have won 18 of the last 19 years). Leicester City got promoted to the Premier League just last year and proceeded to be in dead last the entire year until they somehow won 7 of their last 9 to avoid relegation. They opened this year as odds on favorites to be relegated and sports betting places had them 5000 to 1 to win the title"
18607168967,"May 1, 2016, 10:23 AM",No,Wow

18609894948,"May 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",Yes,Well Jamie Vardy (who apparently was working in a factory while playing for a team in a 7th tier English league) broke a record this year by scoring 11 games in a row and has been their biggest star this year
18609894948,"May 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",Yes,He was working in the factory 5 years ago
18609894948,"May 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",Yes,HeÍs suspended for this game though
18609894948,"May 1, 2016, 10:25 AM",Yes,"He got a double yellow last game, the second one for diving"

18607168967,"May 1, 2016, 10:40 AM",No,Which makes sense because associates were laid the same in 2009 as they are in 2016
18607168967,"May 1, 2016, 10:41 AM",No,But columbia is basically the only school that raised cost of attendance for somebody with my stats as the job market got worse and salaries remained the same

18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,Let me start off with don't do it
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,I turned it down but I'm curious in retrospect 
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,But it was incredible
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,"It's like your brain filters out a lot of things usually but when you are on lsd, it stops"
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,That's a very strange thought
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,How similar is it to weed?
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,So you are really aware of lots of little details that usually you aren't
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,Not at all similar to weed
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,"Like how people hold their heads, all the vocal intonations, small facial expressions"
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,Huh very strange
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,"It's a little overwhelming, but you understand people so much more and so much deeper "
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,"And when people generalize that, they call it the ability to see auras"
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,Oh
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,"And you get that about every living thing, not just people"
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,So that's actually kind of a thing
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,And then there are some visuals
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,Like colors swirl
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,And the hair on your arms kind of breathes
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,Well that's just weird
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,Nah
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,Picture trippy visuals
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,Those are based off of acid trips haha
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,Okay I have them
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,"Also, you are aware of yourself as like a being"
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,So like you can kind of step outside yourself
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,And realize that drinking/euphoria/pain etc... Aren't that intense or meaningful
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,And I have heard of the out of body experience 
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,A lot of descriptions online are pretty accurate
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,And I'm sure there are good descriptions of the visuals online
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,Interesting
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,Sometimes my vision would stretch
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,Stretch?
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,Like vertically so everything was huge or squished
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,Oh wow 
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,And it would be smoothly going from stretched to squished and back and forth
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,Did that feel incredibly distracting?
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,I know it does something with the filtering part of the brain and something visual
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,Not really
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,"I mean I was like wow that's weird, but it's not like I was trying to do hw at the time"
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,I really wanted to go to a science class on lsd
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,I thought that would have been incredible
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,Yeah that would have felt very mind opening
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,It's really cool
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,Ummm
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,So lsd highs follow a curve
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,I'll find it online
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:15 PM",No,lsd high graph 
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,But I think the peaks and valleys were sharper
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,This is actually a bad graph and I can't find the good one online
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,But it's definitely cyclical
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,and I think the cycles get weaker and more spread out over time
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:18 PM",No,Google image lsd visuals
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:18 PM",No,And those are kind of accurate (but not really)
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:19 PM",No,Lsd sticks with you for a while
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:19 PM",No,And it definitey changed my behavior for a month or so after taking it
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:19 PM",No,Maybe more
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:19 PM",No,I lost a lot of libido
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:19 PM",No,I can find some stuff online about it
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:20 PM",No,But it's not a completely common after effect
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,That's a long after effect
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:44 PM",No,I would even say it lasted 3 months to a year
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:44 PM",No,Like don't do drugs
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:44 PM",No,They are bad for you
18609676168,"May 7, 2016, 11:46 PM",No,That's crazy long
18607168967,"May 7, 2016, 11:47 PM",No,Yes
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 2:14 AM",No,This weeks riddler is interesting 
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 9:08 AM",Yes,I havenÍt tried to solve it yet
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 9:08 AM",Yes,It seems easy to monte carlo for any given n/m
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 10:36 AM",No,But then you need to store those and run it through some sort of regression 
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 2:45 PM",No,Anyways do you guys want to plan to talk trip tonight?
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 2:56 PM",Yes,When
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,730/8 your time? When do you want to?
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 2:59 PM",Yes,Im driving to middletown to have dinner with my parents at 6:30
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 2:59 PM",Yes,I wouldnÍt think IÍd be back until 9 or so
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,Hmm I might be able to do that but not positive
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 3:00 PM",Yes,Or I could do like now
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,David- are you ready for a phone call!
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,?*
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,I could do right now
18607168967,"May 8, 2016, 3:05 PM",No,No 
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 3:09 PM",No,Okay can you pick and coordinate a time to meet then?
18607168967,"May 8, 2016, 3:11 PM",No,I can move stuff around and do now
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 3:11 PM",Yes,IÍm free until 5:30
18607168967,"May 8, 2016, 3:12 PM",No,Let's just do now. Helitzer can you initiate the call
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 3:12 PM",Yes,"He just had to run to do something, IÍm not sure his timeline"
18607168967,"May 8, 2016, 3:13 PM",No,I think I'm going to switch to chcicago
18607168967,"May 8, 2016, 3:13 PM",No,It's a better school
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 3:13 PM",Yes,"Chicago is a great school, I think youÍd do great there"
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 3:35 PM",No,I'm free in like10 but not for very long
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 5:38 PM",No,Lol there's a guy on our roof pretty aggressively selling weed gummies
18609894948,"May 8, 2016, 5:39 PM",Yes,you buy any?
18609676168,"May 8, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,Lol no
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:08 AM",No,So epic has its first de-installing customer 
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:16 AM",Yes,Oh shit
18605603559,"May 9, 2016, 10:33 AM",No,Hello
18605603559,"May 9, 2016, 10:33 AM",No,I'm alive
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:43 AM",No,And that customer is the one that I've been reaching out to for a lot of questions on my Florida install
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:44 AM",No,And I'm starting to wonder if maybe it's not best to model them
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:44 AM",Yes,lol
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:44 AM",Yes,Maybe not
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:45 AM",No,But I also just wondering if the mix of 3rd party systems and applications is just doomed
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:46 AM",No,Both GW (uninstalling)and Watson are on epic for ambulatory clinical and GE IDX for rev/access
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:48 AM",Yes,Why are they uninstalling
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,Allegedly revenue issues (all of this is very third hand knowledge)
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,End user satisfaction was high
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",Yes,What kind of revenue issues
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,Lower revenue post go live
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",Yes,Like Epic cost too much? Or it was fucking up revenue streams
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,Like they weren't billing as much
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,(All very allegedly)
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",Yes,But that has nothing to do with epic
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,Yeah it does
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:50 AM",Yes,They choose what procedures to bill for and how much
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:50 AM",No,It's not that simple 
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:50 AM",No,There's variable markups and how you handle insurance companies trying to bargain and stuff
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:50 AM",No,And how you code the work that was performed
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:50 AM",Yes,Yeah
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:50 AM",Yes,But all that stuff is customizable
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:51 AM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:51 AM",No,And most of it would have been happening in GE IDX still but idk
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:51 AM",No,I really don't have enough information to properly defend their position
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 10:52 AM",No,But I'm really curious to see if they'll talk about it at staff meeting
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 10:59 AM",Yes,Think the billing people will get fired?
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,Their entire c suite got fired
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 11:29 AM",Yes,No I mean epic people
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:36 AM",No,I doubt it
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:37 AM",No,I mean they didn't have any actual billing people on the customer (epiccare ambulatory) so it would just be the amb team and interface team setting up epic to send charges back to IDX 
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:37 AM",No,But they'll need those teams to help them with the deinstalled
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 11:38 AM",Yes,Sounds like a mess
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:38 AM",No,And I know the interface team and I know they're still at epic
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:38 AM",No,It is a mess
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:38 AM",No,"We're losing one of our ""hills to stand on"""
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 11:39 AM",No,We've bragged so much about no deinstalls
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 12:13 PM",Yes,Meh it was bound to happen
18609894948,"May 9, 2016, 12:13 PM",Yes,Still a pretty impressive ratio 
18605603559,"May 9, 2016, 12:13 PM",No,Downfall of epic
18605603559,"May 9, 2016, 12:13 PM",No,Gg
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,"I wonder if she'll change our ""hills to stand on"" slide"
18609676168,"May 9, 2016, 12:24 PM",No,"Currently we have a slide with hills for all the points she likes to brag about (top KLAS rankings, no deinstalls, etc)"
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:35 PM",No,The dorm I liked at michigan emailed me telling me they are full
18605603559,"May 10, 2016, 1:38 PM",No,Chicago bro!
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,Yeah I immediately sent an email to chcicago saying I fucked up (their deadline was april 29) and they forwarded my email to the admissions committee
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,I was basically bait and switched at michigan
18605603559,"May 10, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,Dude
18605603559,"May 10, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,lol
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 1:41 PM",Yes,ItÍs not bait and switch that you couldnÍt get into a dorm
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 1:41 PM",Yes,Glad youÍre happy with Chicago though
18605603559,"May 10, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,Chicago 
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:42 PM",No,So there are two dorms for lawyers and I spoke to the director of the other dorm (the lawyers club) and she said that I should be able to be placed into the dorm I wanted because of my food allergies
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:42 PM",No,And then I was waitlisted at that dorm
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:42 PM",No,And so I contacted the people in rea life and disability services
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,And they told me that they wouldn't do anything to help
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 1:43 PM",Yes,Well
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 1:43 PM",Yes,Chicago
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,"So it wasn't a bait and switch by admissions, but the univeristy overall. Or at least I feel that it is almost a bait and switch"
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 1:43 PM",Yes,Word
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,That might be enough to get your deposit back but you'll probably have to fight for it
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,Also sounds like you should go to Chicago
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,We'll see if they let me
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,Michigan also sent me a letter yesterday saying I could deposit at multiple schools
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,"If they were upfront Abou that, I would already have deposited at Chicago"
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,I'm not happy with michigan right now haha
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,That's fair 
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,Had you asked them if you could multi deposit/does Chicago Audi let you multi deposit?
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,Chcicago has a form that makes it clear you can multi deposit up until June 15
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,I had not asked michigan
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,I probably should have
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,I definitely made several mistakes this cycle. Lsat. Applying early. Asking questions about dorms. Multiple deposits. Negotiating and not including Chicagos offer because their offer was lower
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,I have to talk to the dean of chcicago at 1130 tomorrow
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:17 PM",No,I've just had like at 4 milf panic attacks about this law school shit. The process was so good up until the end
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:30 PM",No,That's going to be an interesting phone call
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:31 PM",No,Yeah. 
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:34 PM",No,My guess is I'll have to send columbia an i tucked up email
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:35 PM",No,My theory about what will happen 1)chicago says they will accept with reduced scholarship. 2) I send an email to columbia. They say ok. 3) I go to columbia
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:35 PM",No,Michigan had this slight slight edge
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:35 PM",No,And it lost it
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:36 PM",No,But basically every school has personally offended me at this point except duke and chicago
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:36 PM",No,(Midwest and south)
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:38 PM",No,How much scholarship do you think you'd lose at Chicago in order to decide to go to Columbia instead?
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:38 PM",No,Any
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:39 PM",No,I like nyc. I would have a better time there
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:39 PM",No,I should probably just suck it up and ask them if they will let me take the debt at this point
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:40 PM",No,My role model from brown aepi went there. Did two federal clerkships and is working in DC next year at a top 5 firm
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:41 PM",No,"But he's rich, so he never had to worry about debt"
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:41 PM",No,Yeah how much do clerkships fuck up debt repayment?
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:41 PM",No,Not much
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:41 PM",No,Most schools have a debt repayment program for public interest and clerkships
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,They reduce the payments you make during the time that you make little money
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Like they make your monthly payments from when you start or if you stay in those long enough they'll forgive debt?
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,The fed gov forgives debt if you do it for 10 years
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Basically is it just deferring the debt or actually reducing it during that time?
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,The school reduces monthly payments during the actual time
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:43 PM",No,It's deferring the debt
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:43 PM",No,Kk
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:45 PM",No,Well I think any of those schools will give you lots of opportunities
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:45 PM",No,Which may or may not be the same thing
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:45 PM",No,Or at least will have opportunities for their students
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:48 PM",Yes,Repayment stuff doesn't pay you for clekships
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:48 PM",No,On a separate topic I got my first minion today
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:48 PM",Yes,The expectations is you will make 60k more after a clerkship 
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,More than you would be making normally in private practice?
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,Or in working for the state?
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,/federal
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:49 PM",Yes,Yeah like a 60k bump on top of your original private practice salary
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:49 PM",Yes,"60k for the first clerkship, 80k for the second"
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:50 PM",No,Huh
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:50 PM",No,That seems like a lot
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,Do you still come in as a first year associate or would you come in at like second or third year?
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,Second or third
18609676168,"May 10, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,And if you came in at second/third year would the bump be on top of the normal first year salary or normal second/third?
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",Yes,First year
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,It's a signing bonus
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,Of 50k
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",Yes,No
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,And then you make what a second/third year makes
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,If you do scotus
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,You get 150k
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,Signing
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",Yes,It's a salary increase 
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,Look it up bri
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,You're wrong
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:53 PM",Yes,You come in making 220 instead of 160
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:54 PM",No,You also get a signing bonus
18609894948,"May 10, 2016, 3:54 PM",Yes,You get a signing bonus regardless 
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,"Haha I will state the whole thing for Helitzer. If you do a 1 year fed clerkship and then go to a firm, you get a 50k signing bonus and then make what a second year makes"
18607168967,"May 10, 2016, 3:56 PM",No,"If you do two years at a fed clerkship and then go to a firm, you get a 50k signing bonus and make what a third year makes "

18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 11:37 AM",No,"Yeah. It wasn't the worst email of all time, but certainly not the right thing to do nor the best argument I could have made for my candidacy"
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 11:38 AM",No,It was the first time that I had been drunk in a while. I forgot how it really lowers impulse control and what weird impulses I have laying just below the surface
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,"The essence of the email was I am ""desperate"" to attend hls (horrible way to negotiate, coming from a position of complete weakness and showing no professionalism). And that the essence of why I messed up the logic game I did was because the Kaplan strategy failed that type of game. You needed to draw out three limited options, but Kaplan only tells you to draw out limited options when there are two possibilities. So I was like don't let my choice of Kaplan over powerscore change the course of my life"
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,Then I said I had the top grade in my Logic class at brown
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,"Then I checked my records and realized I could not back that statement up, so I sent a follow up email saying that I could not back that statement up"
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,lol wtf
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,"(I had emailed a few months ago that I had been doing better on practice lsats and that I just messed up a logic game and gave my sat, gre, and mcst score)"
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,wtf
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,Lol
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 11:59 AM",No,Using the word desperation and then saying I had an honor I didn't were no good though
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,And emailing at like 2am on sat night/sun morning
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,Doesn't come across too well
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,"Also I addressed the letter to Dean soban, not the admissions committee"
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,Dude why did you think the email would work haha
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,It's true that the Kaplan lsat strategy is worse and I think somebody in the admissions office must know that
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,"But mostly, I was drunk"
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,I'm sure people used the Kaplan strategy and got 180s so it means nothing
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,Haha
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,I hate the lsat and the test bri and I took had a question that was particularly advantageous to the people who studied with powerscore
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Why aren't you happy with the schools you got into?
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Majority of people couldn't go to those
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,Law school/being a lawyer in NYC is like this prestige ladder
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,"(I don't really think it is like that outside of biglaw, but it might be)"
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,And you can like only move down the ladder
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,Then why Michigan
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,So you want to start as high as possible
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,When you had Chicago and Columbia
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,If it matters that much
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,You would have gotten no money from Harvard
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,Harvard is worth the debt
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,The t3 schools are worth the debt
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,It's unclear if t6 schools are
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,There is no clear consensus
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,Dude you also can't blame Kaplan for your score lol
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,I totally can
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,you chose your study resources
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,and when to take the exam
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,"That's true, but you don't know what you don't know"
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,no one does going into the exam
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,That's why it's fair
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:07 PM",No,"If you use a tool and it breaks, you can sue the manufacurer (?)"
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:08 PM",No,Lol
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:09 PM",No,It doesn't matter though. I wasn't getting into Harvard anyway
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:09 PM",No,I just learned more about my alcohol problem
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,I think you need to stop thinking in certain ways lol
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,You got the score you got
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,It's noone else's fault
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:32 PM",No,"And if you really feel like it wasn't you, you always have the option of retaking it 4 times a year"
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,Which you have to register over a month in advance for 
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,I realize I am annoying and you don't want to hear any more about this
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,But I do not think I am wrong
18609894948,"May 15, 2016, 12:36 PM",Yes,No he's right
18609894948,"May 15, 2016, 12:36 PM",Yes,Everyone has extenuating circumstances 
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,Or that the countermeasures in place by the lsac (canceling and retaking) are adequate
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:37 PM",No,For example gre lets you take the test whenever as long as you register one day in advance
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:38 PM",No,That is a more fair system
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:38 PM",No,But David if Harvard is really worth the debt then you can go ahead and fork over 4 test registration fees in advanced
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:39 PM",No,And keep taking them until you get your score
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:39 PM",No,or cancel
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:39 PM",No,"Yeah, if I had the knowledge that I had at the start that I do now, I think that I would do something like that"
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:39 PM",No,Haha and only I can be blamed for not having that knowledge
18609894948,"May 15, 2016, 12:40 PM",Yes,Dude if you care this much then work to transfer
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,But I think that is definitely the optimal strategy
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,If you transfer you are at a disadvantage for jobs as far as I can tell
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,then take the year off
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,And reapply
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,Because the on campus interviewing takes place the week before 2l
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,And retake the LSAT
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,If it matters that much
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,My friend did that
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,And then he scored at the bottom of his lsat range again
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,Exact same score as he got the first time
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,He was not happy
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,So
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,I am definitely wary of that route
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,then how can you complain about a company faulting you in their strategy
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,If you have the option of retaking it using another strategy
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,And still risk the chance of a same score
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,"I don't disagree that the lsat seems fair, but in practice the long period of planning in advance and different study resources make knowing the right way to attack the lsat unfair in that there is either subtlety in prepping for it or more luck required than a test like the gre"
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:45 PM",No,I think the test would be fine if it was offered like once a month and you could register for it same month
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:45 PM",No,And I think transferring would be better if jobs were before 3l
18609894948,"May 15, 2016, 12:45 PM",Yes,Nothing's ever gonna be fair 
18609894948,"May 15, 2016, 12:46 PM",Yes,It's the same way with job invterviews 
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:46 PM",No,I guess that means one shouldn't try to make fair systems?
18609894948,"May 15, 2016, 12:46 PM",Yes,You don't get a redo 
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:47 PM",No,Or David get a better job than Brian
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:47 PM",No,And then be like Harvard isn't all that
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:47 PM",No,instead of dwindling on things of the past
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 12:47 PM",No,Not how it works. Name follows you around forever
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:47 PM",No,And graduate first
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:48 PM",No,I'm much more impressed by 1st in class at uchicago or Michigan than a random Harvard law grad
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:48 PM",No,pretty sure you can do whatever you want as number 1
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:49 PM",No,It's on you dude
18605603559,"May 15, 2016, 12:52 PM",No,It shows a work ethic that is unrivaled by 99.9% of law students and any firm would salivate over that
18609676168,"May 15, 2016, 1:01 PM",No,Yeah agreed
18609676168,"May 15, 2016, 1:02 PM",No,And while you've done a fantastic job thoroughly identifying proximal causes I'm unconvinced that was a better use of your time and effort than trying to plan/prepare/optimize for your future endeavors
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 1:06 PM",No,I mean that is true unless I can somehow market the proper way to do the lsat and make a lot of money
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 1:06 PM",No,"I heard about a kid at yale with a 3.97, 42, bme that didn't get into any med school. That kid has way more to be angry about than me haha"
18609676168,"May 15, 2016, 1:09 PM",No,I guess that is the edge case but it seems unlikely
18609676168,"May 15, 2016, 1:09 PM",No,Where as you going to law school or doing anything else that isn't revising the lsat seems very very likely 
18607168967,"May 15, 2016, 1:10 PM",No,That is a valid argument
18609676168,"May 16, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,"Carly and I are watching ""how we got to know""and it seems pretty good so far"
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,Starting law school in two weeks (probably)
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 4:18 PM",No,Just have to find a place to live
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:10 PM",No,Nice!
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:28 PM",No,"""The new new thing"" by Michael Lewis is pretty good"
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:33 PM",No,Oh is that the healtheon book?
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:34 PM",No,I read the back cover a few months ago
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:34 PM",No,Maybe? They're calling their company healthscape right now
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:34 PM",No,Jim Clark and Netscape have been the main other topics so far
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:35 PM",No,"If I do summer start I can't do campus dance and see my friends in prov, but whatevs"
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,Idk what campus dance is
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,10k person dance at brown for graduation
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,Lots of alums come back
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,Oh cool
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,It's really cool
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,I've been for the past 5 years
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,But I'm sure you'll make lots of friends in Ann Arbor 
18607168967,"May 17, 2016, 5:37 PM",No,I think summer start is good for that
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:37 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:37 PM",No,Summer in Madison is gorgeous 
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:37 PM",No,I think Ann Arbor is similar
18609676168,"May 17, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,Yeah it just rebranded to healtheon
18609894948,"May 17, 2016, 7:34 PM",Yes,I might drive out to michigan the week of june 26 with a couple friends
18609894948,"May 17, 2016, 7:34 PM",Yes,My sister will be there
18605603559,"May 18, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,
18605603559,"May 18, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,She didn't go to Columbia!!!
18605603559,"May 18, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,She was a Barnard girl

18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,Everything about Barnard is hilarious
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,It's like the epitome of a place to attend for an mrs
18605603559,"May 18, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,
18605603559,"May 18, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,It's like a back door into a school they couldn't get into
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,Columbia law accepts a lot of transfers
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,100
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,Which is 1/5 of final class size
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,They do it so they don't lower stats of admits and to get money
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,Columbia loves this stuff
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,Columbia is bs and I hate columbia
18609676168,"May 18, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,Pretty sure degrees from Barnard still say Columbia on them and that the Ivy League is just a sports conference
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,But it's like a really good sports conference
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,Brown won the first rose bowl 
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,Kind of a big deal
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,Best college football I've ever seen

18609676168,"May 18, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,Tufts used to be a top squash program
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,"If the Ivy League hadn't agreed to not play post season games, they would win every national championship"
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,Like I'm pretty sure every nfl team is half Ivy
18609676168,"May 18, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,Are they even still good at anything besides rowing?
18609894948,"May 18, 2016, 8:46 PM",Yes,I'm so confused what David is talking about
18607168967,"May 18, 2016, 8:46 PM",No,Barnard doesn't even have a tex football team

18609676168,"May 20, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,It seems fascinating
18609676168,"May 21, 2016, 12:05 AM",No,Placing automated orders into a website and getting information back seems really cool
18609676168,"May 21, 2016, 12:06 AM",No,Like when have you ever automated data retrieval for getting information into your code
18609676168,"May 21, 2016, 12:07 AM",No,I also had heard a lot about RESTful JSON as part of EDI's FHIR projects and it seems very cutting edge and this website makes me feel like I'm understanding what those terms actually mean
18607168967,"May 21, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,Staying night

18609894948,"May 21, 2016, 3:15 PM",Yes,I couldnt figure it out
18609676168,"May 21, 2016, 4:38 PM",No,I haven't figured it out yet either but I think you need to use a http handler in your code and have it ping the website 
18609676168,"May 21, 2016, 4:39 PM",No,They have good api documentation although his examples are in ruby which I don't know
18605603559,"May 21, 2016, 4:42 PM",No,Pho guys?

18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 12:07 AM",No,You paid money to be tortured
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,That part probably was relatively safe in comparison with some of the other stuff
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,But yeah borderline torture
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,I hope I like mich

18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 5:46 PM",No,(Boyu sent that message from Brian's phone)
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 6:00 PM",No,I mean you started with what superhero are you
18605603559,"May 22, 2016, 6:00 PM",No,LMAO
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 6:01 PM",No,"Her profile is grad student by day, superhero by night"
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 6:01 PM",No,That makes a little bit not sense
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 6:01 PM",No,More*
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 6:02 PM",No,Let's not be too mean to this girl
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 6:04 PM",No,She's cool

18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 6:34 PM",No,When are you going to play starfighter with me??
18609894948,"May 22, 2016, 6:37 PM",Yes,Lol this seems more fun
18605603559,"May 22, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,Brian still talking to her?
18609894948,"May 22, 2016, 9:46 PM",Yes,No I didn't reply 
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 10:54 PM",No,

18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 11:03 PM",No,Starfighter
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 11:03 PM",No,Literally the only thing I've been talking about all weekend
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,I think you told Lebow about it
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,I don't have the bottom thing in my group text I don't think
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,I have dude I got star fighter to work
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,Then the 
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,"""It took a lot of digging"""
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,Oh weird
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,Very weird
18609676168,"May 22, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,Anyways bed time
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,

18605603559,"May 22, 2016, 11:17 PM",No,Adam what do you think of over watch
18607168967,"May 22, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,I'm calling dibs on Hannah
18605603559,"May 22, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,U banging her again?
18609676168,"May 23, 2016, 7:29 AM",No,Haven't tried it
18609894948,"May 23, 2016, 7:30 AM",Yes,IÍm not talking to her donÍt worry
18609676168,"May 23, 2016, 9:35 AM",No,I wonder how hard it would be to create an actual Python module
18609676168,"May 23, 2016, 10:59 AM",No,Then I could just provide that to you guys so you wouldn't have to figure out how http functions or the stockbroker game APIs work
18609676168,"May 25, 2016, 12:18 AM",No,I think I fully understand what iterables are in Python
18609676168,"May 25, 2016, 12:18 AM",No,And why they can be infinite
18609676168,"May 25, 2016, 12:21 AM",No,And how generator functions work
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Rejected at Harvard
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,Haha she probably just saw that email I sent
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,"And was like ""nope"""
18609894948,"May 26, 2016, 12:04 PM",Yes,Hows the drive
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,Or your email got spam filtered
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,How funny would that be
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 1:19 PM",No,Or their class filled up and so they closed out the waitlist
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,And yeah how's the treks
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,The place I got sucked
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,We made it yesterday
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,We're in overdrive trying to figure something out
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,Damn well good luck 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,I need it haha
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,I got into munger (the dorm I wanted) for te actual year
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,I'm going to talk to them to try to let me move in now
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,Who knows dude
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,It's been a wild and frustrating few hours
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 1:23 PM",No,That's pretty sweet that you got housing for the actual year figured out
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 1:24 PM",No,When do classes start?
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 1:28 PM",No,Fuckkkk
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 1:29 PM",No,
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 2:44 PM",No,I have a really bad feeling about this
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 4:44 PM",No,How was it?
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 4:45 PM",No,any luck David?
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,Yeah 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,I got into munger
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,And they are letting me move in June 1
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,So I'll stay in a hotel for a few days
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 5:10 PM",No,Very nice!
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:26 PM",No,Math is hard
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:27 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:27 PM",No,I should have done math and then ruled the world now
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:27 PM",No,Would have been good
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,Better yet. Do applied math in college. Take enough classes to get a masters
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,Would be easy. Apma is a joke
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,Then do whatever the fuck I wanted
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,That's really the smart play in college if you can do (applied) math
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:30 PM",No,I don't think you even need to constrain it to just studying math in college
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:30 PM",No,It's technical enough that you could convincingly demonstrate skill afterwards
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:30 PM",No,So like do math now?
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,Or I the past two years lol
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,Hahaha
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,You know I kind of planned to do that
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,And never did
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:32 PM",No,Seems like a good if hard idea
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,Math is so stupid though
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,It's unclear what you use it for
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,Building really advanced models
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,Eh
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,I don't even believe in probability
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,I believe there are probablistic models
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,But nature is definitely deterministic
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:34 PM",No,Even if the territory is deterministic it could still follows that our best maps are probabilistic 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:35 PM",No,Yes
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:35 PM",No,Although I don't think it's a sure thing by any stretch that nature is actually deterministic 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:35 PM",No,Probability literally makes no sense though
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:35 PM",No,The idea that you know every single thing about a situation
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:35 PM",No,You have perfect knowledge
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:36 PM",No,You know everything that effects the outcome of a situation
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:36 PM",No,I think you have to discount quantum and quantum world theory almost entirely to assume you actually have perfect knowledge tho
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:36 PM",No,Every single thing
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:36 PM",No,And then you don't know what will happen next
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Oh because you can't know velocity and momentum or whatever?
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Well you don't know with certainty 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,The uncertainty principle?
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Why is that even a thing
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Because it reflects nature
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Is that just an empirical observation or is there a reason you can't have perfect knowldge?
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,There's a reason
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:38 PM",No,But also empirical evidence
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:39 PM",No,It's that small objects have fundamentally wave like behavior
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:39 PM",No,And waves can't have definite position and momentum
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:39 PM",No,Why would that have wave like behavior?
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:39 PM",No,Seems dumb
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:39 PM",No,Double slit experiment and tunneling and stuff couldn't happen without wave behavior
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:40 PM",No,I think it's more weird that it all collapses down upon inspection
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:40 PM",No,Nah just because we can't describe it without using waves doesn't mean it has to be waves
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:40 PM",No,Like you can fire electrons one at a time through a double slit and once you observe them they'll collapse down
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,The double slit experiment is really weird
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Tunneling is weirder
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,It's the equivalent of costing up a hill without enough kinetic energy to get to the top and then appearing on the other side
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Tunneling is like when one electron jumps?
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,But you can actually watch it happen with an electron microscope
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,Clearly our model of the atom is just wrong
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,That's what those experiments say to me
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,And electrons are probably conglomerates of a bunch of molecules
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,And there's some reactions that wouldn't happen at the observable temperature without tunneling 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,*small particles
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Electrons just aren't single particles
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,It's a simple solution
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Boom. Fuck you physics
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,It still doesn't work if they're just composed of smaller things
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Then firing two electrons repeatedly through double slits shouldn't produce the distribution they did
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Unless they're waves
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,Or unless they're more like waves than particles at least
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,Nah. They just effect eachother when there is more than one
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,I think that is a stupid way to conceptualize it
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,But I think it even works if you just fire one
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,It's a false dichotomy
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,Because it still goes through both slits until you observe it
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,It might be a false dichotomy but they sure as hell aren't particles
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:46 PM",No,And there's only so much more additional complexity you can add before the wave explanation becomes more likely than an absurdly constrained third possibility
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:46 PM",No,I'm setting up a date with a fat jewish girl for when my dad leaves
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:47 PM",No,A wave doesn't make any intuitive sense though
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:47 PM",No,Yeah but there's also a point where it's absurd to trust your intuition 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:47 PM",No,"Like in 100 years they'll be like ""morons in the the 1900s and 2000s thought that electrons were waves"""
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:47 PM",No,I really don't think so
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:48 PM",No,They are clearly better modeled by complex fields that interact with one another
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:48 PM",No,I think it'll be closer to how we now know the earth isn't spherical 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:48 PM",No,And have a hidden reserve of energy that we don't understand
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:48 PM",No,But it's not like a sphere was as bad of a model as a flat sheet
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:49 PM",No,"Or that an oblate spheroid was as bad as a sphere, etc."
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:49 PM",No,"I think I'm just fundamentally a believer of ""degrees of wrong"" for chemistry/physics/math"
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:49 PM",No,I think the total reversal appear far more often in biology/nutrition/psychology
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,Haha right
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,I agree
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,Because we keep being able to build more and more advanced technology on our understandings of physics
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,Except for math
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,Which is never wrong
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:51 PM",No,"There's ""lies we teach to children"" like you can't take the sqrt of a negative number"
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:51 PM",No, But that's about it that I know of for math
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:51 PM",No,You can't
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:51 PM",No,Can you?
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:51 PM",No,i
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:52 PM",No,Yeah i is a made up thing
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:52 PM",No,(Except you can do weird things with it with what's it called transforms)
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:52 PM",No,It models circuits really well tho 
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:53 PM",No,Like we don't have another math concept that works to model circuits as well as i
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:54 PM",No,Yeah it's by this really crazy electrics engineer
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:54 PM",No,That couldn't prove his math
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:54 PM",No,Nobody understood it
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:54 PM",No,But it worked
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:54 PM",No,What's the tranform caled?
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:55 PM",No,It's that the real part models the present current and the imaginary part models the future current 
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:55 PM",No,There is a name for the transform named after the guy
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:55 PM",No,Probs
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:55 PM",No,But that's the heart of it
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:56 PM",No,We learned it in apma 33
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:56 PM",No,And that's not what my professor said
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:56 PM",No,And he was Belarusian
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:57 PM",No,"When electrical engineers analyzed alternating current circuits, they found that quantities of voltage, current and resistance (called impedance in AC) were not the familiar one-dimensional scalar quantities that are used when measuring DC circuits.  These quantities which now alternate in direction and amplitude possess other dimensions (frequency and phase shift) that must be taken into account."
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:57 PM",No,http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algtrig/ato6/electricalresouce.htm
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:58 PM",No,Phase shift being future/present
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 8:58 PM",No,And magnitude being amount
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:59 PM",No,I forget what I am trying to say
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 8:59 PM",No,I knew it at one point
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:00 PM",No,It is not about what you are saying
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:00 PM",No,It's the guy couldn't do a proof to show his transform made sense mathematically
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:00 PM",No,But he model it produced worked
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:00 PM",No,Interesting
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:00 PM",No,And then later on people figured out the math
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:01 PM",No,Does that just happen when you introduce a fundamentally new concept?
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:01 PM",No,Laplace tranform
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:01 PM",No,Ohhhhhh
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:01 PM",No,That was a weird one
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:01 PM",No,It was useful for diffeq for some reason
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:02 PM",No,But fuck knows why
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:02 PM",No,Haha right
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:02 PM",No,We never took the important courses haha
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,Yeah I just learned algebra
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,And occasionally snippets as they were used in engineering
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:05 PM",No,We should have mathed
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:05 PM",No,Also fundamentals control the market
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:05 PM",No,Not math
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:06 PM",No,Like models based off of complex math done to past performance are stupid
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:08 PM",No,There is a fundamental disconnect there
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:08 PM",No,Between really really advanced math and really mediocre data input
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:09 PM",No,You are a fundamental disconner there
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:14 PM",No,Has there ever been a jew on the moon
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,Mark zuckerberg
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,Ghandi

18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,What do all of these people have in common?
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,They were all once babies
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,I think being a baby has the best exit opprotunities
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,I was going to say at least half white males
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,I think I should try to become a baby
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,Seems like a base rate fallacy
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,What's that?
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,Oh looked it up
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,It is indeed a base rate fallacy
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,Do you really believe in a deterministic world?
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,I got new sunglasses yesterday
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,I think it would explain some of the fundamental disagreements I've had with some of your reasonings 
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,And I fucking put them in my pocket like a retard and scratched hem
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,Fuck
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,My

18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,I was tired after vball not thinking
18609676168,"May 26, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Don't buy nice new stuff if you're not going to take care of it
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Fuckkkkkk
18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,Pics of the sunglasses (Boyus style has been out of control recently)
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,The lenses are replaceable
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,But they're 80

18607168967,"May 26, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,Those sunglasses did not disappoint
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,OMG
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,They're so expensive

18609894948,"May 26, 2016, 10:53 PM",Yes,and they will fix them
18605603559,"May 26, 2016, 10:56 PM",No,Looked it up scratches not under warranty

18607168967,"May 27, 2016, 8:50 AM",No,Moral of this story is if you try hard enough and stress enough
18607168967,"May 27, 2016, 8:51 AM",No,A random thing happens that is totally unrelated to your efforts
18609676168,"May 27, 2016, 8:52 AM",No,Lol

18609676168,"May 28, 2016, 1:40 PM",No,I think it only affects salaried workers
18609676168,"May 28, 2016, 1:40 PM",No,And I think it's that he had some dispute and wasn't allowed to pursue class action

18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 1:55 PM",Yes,Living through David
18607168967,"May 30, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,Girl and I made plans. She stopped texting me. Won't confirm. So annoying
18605603559,"May 30, 2016, 3:24 PM",No,Gg brah
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 7:56 PM",No,
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 7:57 PM",Yes,I got 88.4
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 7:57 PM",Yes,With a lot less code
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 7:58 PM",Yes,But it looks like you had all the teams play each other
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 7:58 PM",Yes,I couldn't tell if that was required or not
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:00 PM",No,I got 91.6
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:00 PM",No,I think they're supposed to play each other 
18607168967,"May 30, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,I got 90.0 exactly
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,What did you do?
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:01 PM",Yes,Considering they were modeling off baseball and they play out of their division in baseball I assumed not vs each other
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:02 PM",Yes,I also don't see why it would make a difference 
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,I would think that forcing them to play each other would decrease the max wins
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:03 PM",Yes,I would think that if anything it would increase std dev
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:04 PM",Yes,But not change the average 
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:04 PM",No,Because it should decrease variance as the total wins across the 5 teams have to stay constant
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:04 PM",No,But I'm starting to think that they shouldn't be playing each other
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:04 PM",Yes,It's really unclear
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:05 PM",Yes,I had that thought from when I first saw the problem
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:05 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:07 PM",No,But anyways I feel like if they play each other then you can only have a couple teams have a feasible shot at being well above average
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:08 PM",No,Where as if they're all playing externally each of the 5 teams has a chance of being a high scoring team
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:08 PM",Yes,Yeah but same with below
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:08 PM",Yes,So only std dev should be different 
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,"But you just care about finding one max, "
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,So a lower std Dev should decrease the distance of the outliers
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:18 PM",Yes,What do you get it you write a simulation without playing each other?
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:19 PM",No,Idk I'll try that next
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:19 PM",No,I'm doing the gem one right now
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:19 PM",No,Should be easy
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:20 PM",Yes,Oh I did that one
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:20 PM",Yes,It's super easy
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:22 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:22 PM",Yes,HereÍs my baseball:
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:22 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:26 PM",No,Also do you know how to get Python to recognize functions that you've made but are in different saved files
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:26 PM",No,Do you have to turn them into modules and import them?
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:27 PM",Yes,I don't know
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:27 PM",Yes,That's too advanced for me
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:29 PM",No,Tried to modularize it a bit
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:30 PM",Yes,Looks solid 
18605603559,"May 30, 2016, 8:30 PM",No,I need to lose weight
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:31 PM",Yes,Agreed
18605603559,"May 30, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,I want to be at 160 so I can jump high as fuck
18605603559,"May 30, 2016, 8:31 PM",No,Lmao
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,Dude cocaine
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,Kills appetitive
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:33 PM",No,Appetite 
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:34 PM",No,Also I'm getting 88.43 when they play out of their league
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:34 PM",Yes,Yeah that's what I got 
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:35 PM",No,I guess my intuition just sucks
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:35 PM",Yes,I don't really have a good explanation for it either 
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:38 PM",No,What do you get when you have them play each other?
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:38 PM",Yes,That seemed like a lot of effort so I didn't do it
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:38 PM",No,Also the += notation would save you some repetitions 
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 8:39 PM",Yes,Yeah also I wrote that baseball code as inefficient as possible
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 8:53 PM",No,Can you do it when they do play each other?
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,I donÍt know what IÍm doing lol
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,Can you open that?
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,Thats what I tried
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:14 PM",Yes,It didnÍt work
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,I can open it but Jesus modularize your code brobeans
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:16 PM",Yes,yeah haha
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:17 PM",No,Also you'll keep selecting teams that have already played 162 games I think
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:17 PM",Yes,Yeah I know
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,Teams that have already played 162 could be opponents of teams that hadnÍt yet played 162
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,But it wouldnÍt count towards their own win total
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,I was hoping that wouldnÍt fuck it up too much
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,But each team is supposed to play 162 games I thought
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,They are
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,Oh that might work anyways
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,Only 162
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",Yes,But it would be pretty close I think
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:18 PM",No,"Otherwise you have some games that are essentially played against ""outside teams"""
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:19 PM",Yes,Yeah but the bigger issue is it doesnÍt work at all
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:19 PM",No,Oh
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:19 PM",Yes,I think this section doesnÍt work
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:19 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:20 PM",Yes,Because my thought was team1 is now c so it becomes c=c+1 and c would increase by 1
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:20 PM",Yes,But I donÍt think that works
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,Well you're switching between team1 being numbers at the selection of which team
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:20 PM",Yes,yeah
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,And the*
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:21 PM",Yes,so that probably fucks it up
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,Yeah def
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:26 PM",Yes,Meh
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:27 PM",Yes,I changed it
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:27 PM",Yes,Still not working
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:27 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:31 PM",Yes,I got it to work
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:31 PM",Yes,IÍm coming up with an average of 89.4
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:31 PM",Yes,*89.3
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:31 PM",No,Huh weird
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:31 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:32 PM",Yes,If you want to run it
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:32 PM",Yes,But the one thing is letÍs say you get a match of a vs b and a already has 162 games played but b doesnÍt.
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:33 PM",Yes,The match result will count for b but not for a
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:33 PM",Yes,So itÍs not exactly right
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,So I think it's probably a little low
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:36 PM",Yes,How do you quit a loop in python
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,For or while?
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,"I think it's ""break"" tho"
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:37 PM",Yes,Like I want to quit back to the beginning of the loop
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:37 PM",Yes,if games=162 i want to go back and start the loop over
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,"I think ""continue"""
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:38 PM",Yes,oh
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:38 PM",Yes,cool
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:38 PM",Yes,then i can do it right
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:43 PM",Yes,I think the continue is going back to the original for loop instead of the intermediate while loop
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:43 PM",Yes,And then everything gets reinitialized
18609894948,"May 30, 2016, 9:43 PM",Yes,So it doesnÍt work
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,You might get somewhere with break
18609676168,"May 30, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,But it sounds like you probably just need to refactor your code
18609676168,"May 31, 2016, 9:41 AM",No,Anyone have a good intermediate coding challenge?
18609676168,"May 31, 2016, 12:09 PM",No,I'm going to take MIT 6.00x on edX
18609676168,"May 31, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_7+3T2015/info
18605603559,"May 31, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,lol wtf 
18605603559,"May 31, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,I'm not sure why but the whole coding does not interest me
18609676168,"May 31, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,It just seems like one of the few things that is both presentably knowable and almost certainly will play a large role in the future
18609676168,"May 31, 2016, 12:45 PM",No,It's also probably one of the very few truly technical skills where we as a society actually allocate a decent amount of the wealth created to the technician 
18609676168,"May 31, 2016, 6:04 PM",No,I got to debug/fix someone's Python code at work today
18609894948,"May 31, 2016, 6:44 PM",Yes,Boyu what are your plans this coming weekend

18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:23 AM",No,Working at a childcare place or teaching healthcare to some underrepresented kids
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,childcare I'd make 200 a week. The teaching healthcare I'd make 1500 in 4-5 weeks and that's it
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,What would you be doing at childcare
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,Taking care of the kids
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,Age range?
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,they posted the wrong hours so I have to choose between the two
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,How many kids per caretaker
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,8 months to 5 years old I think
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:25 AM",No,And would it be all day or what?
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:25 AM",No,I'm leaning pretty heavily towards teaching
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:25 AM",No,I think you'd get eaten alive in a daycare
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:26 AM",No,Unless it's a daycare for rich parents in which case they'll be insufferable but you'll probably have an okay kid:caretaker ratio
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:26 AM",No,4 hours a day
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:26 AM",No,Dude the other job is brutal too
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:26 AM",No,They're kids from Hartford
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:26 AM",No,so they are really rowdy and stuff
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:26 AM",No,lol either job is brutal
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:27 AM",No,Oh hmm that does make it harder
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:27 AM",No,nothing Ike our classes in weha. I taught healthcare earlier this year
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:27 AM",No,Still unless you like changing diapers I'd teach
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:27 AM",No,uh I don't mind doing one more than the other
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:27 AM",No,But find out the child:caretaker ratio that's super important
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:29 AM",No,3:1 or 4:1 would be very good
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:29 AM",No,If it's more than 12:1 don't take it period
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:30 AM",No,Lol I'll check that today but I have nap time hours anyway tho
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:30 AM",No,10-30-230

18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,That's 90 dollars an hour if true
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,Also it sounds like you could just do both 
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,I can't
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,That one is 1-2
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,it's so gay
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,Oh
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,I originally thought the childcare was 9-12
18605603559,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:34 AM",No,Or 8-12
18609676168,"Jun 1, 2016, 10:41 AM",No,So what else are you going to do this summer? A bunch of volleyball?

18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:36 AM",No,Law school is dumb
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:41 AM",No,How dumb?
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:41 AM",No,Not sure if grad program that leads to jobs that make a lot of money or 3rd grade
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:41 AM",No,Why not both?
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:41 AM",No,I think it is
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:42 AM",No,Dude just get a PhD in stem
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:42 AM",No,Bschool preschool so they say
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:42 AM",No,But one you don't have to work in a lab for
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 10:43 AM",No,PhDs are long tho
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 12:07 PM",No,Yeah but you learn for the first year
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:09 PM",No,There's a lot of ways/things to learn so that by itself doesn't seem particularly compelling 
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:13 PM",No,I mean I don't think we ever really learn again
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:13 PM",No,And only math and logic is learning
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:13 PM",No,Only logic is learning
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:13 PM",No,That's the only way we as humans have to know things
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:14 PM",No,That seems unnecessarily narrow
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:15 PM",No,I'd say any process that gets you knowledge/ability that lets you do or understand/predict something is learning
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 1:17 PM",No,E.g you can learn to surf or teach as well as learning the history of Europe 
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,I think you're narrowing your view to only include pure and perfectly generalizable frameworks
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,And logic might be the only qualifying entity
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,But who cares?
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 8:51 PM",No,Flash boys ends in an insane cliff hanger

18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,I could see the summer weather having a pretty negative effect on dating apps
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:11 PM",No,One is down for a date tomorrow (score)
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:11 PM",No,"One still has me under probation and claims to be busy this weekend, but maybe will go on a date during the week"
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:11 PM",No,Next week
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:11 PM",No,One I didn't ask yet

18609894948,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:13 PM",Yes,I went to the doctor today for a physical and they asked if I had been recently STD tested and ordered a test

18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,Judgmental 
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,I can totally see wanting to avoid having your friends be judgmental
18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:31 PM",No,Dude. Law school is going to be hard
18609894948,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:41 PM",Yes,WerenÍt you saying the opposite yesterday

18607168967,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:57 PM",No,And there hasn't been much studying or dating
18609676168,"Jun 2, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,It gets harder as you get older

18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 1:38 PM",No,I spoke in class today about math and I don't think the professor got it
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 1:38 PM",No,He like didn't understand basic probability 
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 1:39 PM",No,(Whether two things are necessarily dependent)
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 1:39 PM",No,If you have probability for a black man and a white woman and a certain car
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 1:39 PM",No,Then the probability of an interracial couple in a car cannot be independent of the other probabilities
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 1:39 PM",No,He just didn't get it
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,That sucks
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:07 PM",No,Did you try exemplifying the extremes?
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,Like if you know p(black)=0 then p(interracial)=0?
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,Oh I should have said that
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,I did bad at extremes
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,But it was just annoying
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,So like the prof didn't get it
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,And the law students don't know math
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,So everybody probably thinks I am an idiot
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,But they are the idiots
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,I feel like that happens a lot with math
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,But this does seem very basic 
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,#math
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,Should I go on a date tonight or hang with the law students?
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,I think I should hang with the law students
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,I'd hang 
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,pretty formative time
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:13 PM",No,One of the rationality sequences was about how bad people are about updating their beliefs in the face of contrary evidence especially if the evidence is insufficient to flip your position
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,Like if you believe there's a 10:1 odds that X is true and then you get information that's twice as likely to occur if not X 
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,Then you should still believe X but with less certainty
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,What did you mean with the second part?
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,"In reality people rehearse the evidence they had that X was true, see its stronger than the new evidence so instead feel even more confident that X is true "
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,Like you should update your belief that now X is true with 5:1 odds
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,"""Like if you believe there's a 10:1 odds that X is true and then you get information that's twice as likely to occur if not X """
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,Then you get information that's twice as likely to occur if not x
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,What does that mean?
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,Like you get information that would be twice as likely to occur if X was not true
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,So something happened that was more likely to happen if x was not true?
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,So basically if you want to actually demonstrate things you have to use extremes because people have awful intuitions for small changes 
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 2:21 PM",No,I want a gf
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:46 PM",No,The Pirates problem on 538 looks interesting to do programmatically 
18609894948,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:47 PM",Yes,I've seen it beforehand e
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:47 PM",No,I've done it by hand before
18609894948,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:48 PM",Yes,Yeah 
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:48 PM",No,I think you actually told it to me when we were walking or running around the reservoir before
18609894948,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:48 PM",Yes,Possibly
18609894948,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:48 PM",Yes,I think it was on a problem set my senior year
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:49 PM",No,But I think yours was with six pirates and two coins
18609894948,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:49 PM",Yes, Is this different
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,10 pirates 10 coins
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,With a bonus question of r pirates and g coins
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:54 PM",No,Honestly I'm not sure if I could do this one programmatically for the general case
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 8:54 PM",No,And think itd even be decently hard to do by hand for 10 pirates 10 coins
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Eh going out was the wrong decision
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Always dates
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,Dates are the best
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,Because women
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 10:54 PM",No,Yeah but you're going to have a limited amount of time before people close off into their social circles
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 10:56 PM",No,Eh fuck all these people
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,They're your network
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,Nah that's the yale class I transfer to
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,Dude. What am I actually going to do with my life?
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,Become a lawyer?
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,Yeah but after
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,Why's there an after?
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,Why won't med school let me in
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,Can you give medical school a call?
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,That ship has sailed
18607168967,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,I'm still on two waitlists
18609676168,"Jun 3, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,I still think you should go forward assuming that ship has sailed
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 12:36 AM",No,I think I have the pseudo code for the pirate puzzle
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:08 AM",Yes,This is awesome
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:10 AM",Yes,Isn't it just 7^x + 1?
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,Yeah this one seems super easy
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,I think it's just sum of 7^x starting with x=0
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,Well the only hard part of that one was figuring out how to navigate using UNIX 
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,Should I swipe right on girls in my law school class or immediately swipe left even though I'm like interested?
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,I'd say swipe right 
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,Just make sure to not be a dick to then
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,Them*
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 12:22 PM",Yes,Did you get a new challenge Adam
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 12:24 PM",No, I haven't requested one yet
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,I can and probs will later today 
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,The 48 hour time limit gave me flashbacks of some take home exams tho
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 2:47 PM",Yes,I tried to google random programming shit and get it offered to me
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 2:47 PM",Yes,It didn't work
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 2:55 PM",No,I've been googling programming stuff for weeks now
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,Challenge?
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:02 PM",Yes,Adam found his way to a secret Google programming challenge/job interview thing
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,Omg
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,So cool
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:09 PM",No,That's what all those screenshots were
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:10 PM",No,Where did you find it?
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:11 PM",No,I was just doing some research
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:11 PM",No,And then the google screen unfolded and said it looks like you speak our language
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:11 PM",No,Are you interested in a challenge?
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,No
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,But that's so cool
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,Beat all the challenges
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,Become the uber Helitzer
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:17 PM",No,No like that was what it said
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:31 PM",No,Yeah I realized that after I sent the message
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:31 PM",No,Beat all the challenges
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:40 PM",No,I'm going to try to
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Helitzer
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Beat all the challenges
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:51 PM",No,I'm going to be spending so much time programming for the next couple mo this
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 3:52 PM",No,Months
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:24 PM",Yes,Wait why isnÍt there a +1 in your code
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:25 PM",Yes,In the case of x=1 they even said the answer is 8
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:25 PM",Yes,Your code gives 7
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:25 PM",No,There is
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:25 PM",No,Range(X+1)
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:27 PM",Yes,But that just affects what power 7 is raised to
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:28 PM",No,It gives an iterables from 0 to expression
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:28 PM",No,Expression-1
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:28 PM",No,So In this case I want an iterable from 0 to X
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:28 PM",Yes,So if j=1 you would get 1+7+49?
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:29 PM",Yes,ShouldnÍt you just get 1+7?
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:29 PM",Yes,*x=1
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:29 PM",No,No
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:29 PM",No,Because range only goes from 0 to expression-1
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:29 PM",Yes,Oh
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:29 PM",No,So that you expression number of times but starting at 0 not 1
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,Well for x=2 you will get 1+7+49
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,Oh
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,I was being dumb
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",No,Lol no worries
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,I was thinking it was just 1+7^x
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,But itÍs 1 +7^x iterated over x
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",No,Yeah that would be silly
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,I mean 7^x
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,iterated over
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:30 PM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:31 PM",Yes,Makes sense
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:31 PM",Yes,Guess I wouldÍve failed
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:31 PM",No,If you drew a picture it would be apparent 
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:31 PM",No,You can run your code against their test cases before you submit
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:31 PM",No,Idk if they grade with the same test cases tho
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:32 PM",Yes,Yeah if I had thought about it for more than 30 seconds while waiting to pick someone up in my car I probably wouldÍve realized
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:32 PM",Yes,Still though
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:32 PM",Yes,This is why IÍm gonna struggle with this programming class
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:32 PM",No,You could theoretically get a much faster code this way by just precalculating out all the answers and then hard coding up to x=10 for this problem at least
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:32 PM",No,You'll be fine brobeans
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:35 PM",No,I'm sure they'll teach you everything you need to know
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:36 PM",No,Classes rarely expect you to be learning that much out of the class stuff
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:39 PM",Yes,Yeah I'm sure it will be good 
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:41 PM",No,I'm back up to 3 pull-ups with a 45 pound plate
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:42 PM",No,Today's been a good day boys
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:51 PM",Yes,I did 3 sets of squats
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:51 PM",Yes,For the first time in like a month
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 7:51 PM",No,Nice
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,Pull
18605603559,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,Pull what?
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:35 PM",No,I just requested the next challenge
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:35 PM",No,It's a lot harder
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:36 PM",No,
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:42 PM",Yes,Yep
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:43 PM",Yes,Are all the meetings they list in one day
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 10:43 PM",Yes,Like they're splitting up a day into 10000000 equal pieces
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,Some chinese girl
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,She's a Minh
18607168967,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,*mong
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:03 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:04 PM",No,Are there 100 possible meetings that you could schedule or is it saying there's scheduled 100 meetings
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:04 PM",No,Like figuring out the schedule for one day with 100 meetings
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:05 PM",Yes,It's saying there's some number of meetings between 1 and 100
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:05 PM",Yes,You don't know how many
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,Is it saying your schedule has some number of meetings between 1 and 100
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,Or is it*
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:06 PM",Yes,Some number between 1 and 100
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,Like is it saying your answer (meetings) will be between 1 and 100?
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,Or is it saying the list you can choose from (they didn't actually name it) is between 1 and 100
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:07 PM",Yes,I think it's saying the list they give you has between 1 and 100 entries 
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:07 PM",Yes,And you need to print out the maximum number that you can schedule in one day 
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,Actually it does say answer(meetings)
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,So I think you're right
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:10 PM",No,Which is good because otherwise my code would explode
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:13 PM",No,I can think of a pretty easy way to brute force it tho
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,And probabaly a slightly faster way to intelligently search for it
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:15 PM",No,So that you don't have to generate every possible combination before you check it for length and validity
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:19 PM",Yes,I guess you could try to start with the shortest appointments?
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:19 PM",Yes,I don't really know how to do this
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,I have two ideas but the smart one takes a lot more to explain 
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,The dumb one is to figure out the absolute maximum number of meetings in a day
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,Like calculate the length of each meeting and see when the sum of the smallest ones breaches 1million
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,And then take number of meetings Choose the length you calculated above
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,And that's how many possible meeting combinations that you have
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:23 PM",Yes,That doesn't work though
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,And then evaluate each meeting combination to see if any are legal
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:23 PM",Yes,Ok yeah if you do that
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,"If they are, great, if not then your length was to long"
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:24 PM",Yes,That's a lot of processing
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,So decrement your length and try again
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,Yeah thus dumb solution
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,Because holy fuck are you going to generate a lot of possibilities that you have to check all of
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,The more intelligent way trims off paths as they become illegal
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,"So you only travel down the paths of the longest, legal, length"
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,The third idea I had was to try to first generate several good guesses (through genetic selection) and then take those as starting paths of method 2 that I outlined
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:28 PM",No,Where you wouldn't quite be guaranteed to get the answer but it could process much much faster 
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:28 PM",No,So you could still trying iterating it several times to confirm that you get the same answer
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,But it'd usually still iterate a lot faster
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:33 PM",Yes,This sounds too hard
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:34 PM",No,I just gave you three different ways to get the answer
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:34 PM",No,How hard could it be
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:34 PM",Yes,Well I donÍt understand how to write the code for any of them
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:34 PM",Yes,So pretty hard
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:35 PM",No,The first one is easy
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:35 PM",Yes,Yeah I guess
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:35 PM",No,Just figure out max number of meetings theoretically possible
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:35 PM",No,Do mCn to generate all the possible combinations
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,Then see which if any were legal
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,If none do mC(n-1)
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,Call recursively until you get a legal solution
18609894948,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:36 PM",Yes,Not efficient at all though
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,And then set a flag to exit the recursion
18609676168,"Jun 4, 2016, 11:37 PM",No,Not efficient at all
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,Boyu Asians sweat in weird places
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,Like their skin doesn't sweat
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,Is that true for you too?
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,Lol wtf
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,Did you bang that girl?
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:29 AM",Yes,David
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:29 AM",Yes,YouÍve changed in the last 5 years
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,Eh more like 2 years as I've been confronted with failure
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,I was much more ambitious and focused and believed in myself more
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Didn't require outside validation
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,Had a vision to change the world and succeed in some vague way
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,But then I was unable to do things
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:37 AM",No,Does that seem accurate?
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,I guess I'm not sure what you're referencing when you say you were unable to do things
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:55 AM",Yes,I mean medical school was a huge setback and I still don't understand why you didn't get in
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:56 AM",Yes,But you had time to do stuff
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,Oh you mean why didn't I learn to code or go into finance or something like that?
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,How I was totally lazy this past year?
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:01 PM",Yes,Or try a startup
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:01 PM",Yes,Eh
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:01 PM",Yes,Regardless
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:02 PM",Yes,I just donÍt know how you got to asking people about how they sweat
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,It was weird dude
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,I'm genuinely curious about if Asians sweat differently than whitr people
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,(I studied Biochem dude and was premed)
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Maybe I'm the weird one but that didn't seem like THAT strange of a question 
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:04 PM",No,Also yeah I feel like you didn't really make full effort tries at enough stuff to be able to say that you were unable to do things 
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:04 PM",Yes,I think it was combined with the texts last night
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,Yeah I've been bragging about my hookups which is bad
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:08 PM",No,But set something I would have done in hs if I had some haha
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:08 PM",No,*def
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:10 PM",No,Oh shit. Google if asian people sweat or sweat differently
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:10 PM",No,They are totally dif
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:10 PM",No,It's crazy
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,Yeah that's weird
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 12:59 PM",No,Lol I'm so dumb
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:00 PM",No,I think there might be a built in sort method for lists
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:00 PM",Yes,I would think there would be
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:06 PM",No,Yes there is
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:06 PM",No,There are several
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:11 PM",No,Well I ended up building my own as well
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:11 PM",No,Which was recently challenging
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:11 PM",No,And unlikely to be efficient
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:12 PM",No,Decently
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:12 PM",No,Yeah dude. List sorting was all the the honors intro class I took was
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:12 PM",No,It's really hard to do it efficiently
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:12 PM",No,The class was just clever things with lists
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:12 PM",No,I hate lists
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:12 PM",No,Haha
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:13 PM",No,It seems really important
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:13 PM",No,And really painful
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:13 PM",No,Have you googled to see if other people found these codig challenges?
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:18 PM",No,A little
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:18 PM",No,I think they're all solved
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:19 PM",No,Do you get a job if you complete them?
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,Some people have
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,But i think by now they know that all the answers are out there
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,Too bad I wasn't doing this two years ago
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:06 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,I can't get pythons built in sorted method to work with a key
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,But I can use my sorting also
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,Algo
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:21 PM",Yes, But the general idea worked?
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:21 PM",No,Yeah 
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:21 PM",No,I just can't get the built in sorted function to work like how I thought it would
18609894948,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:21 PM",Yes,Look at us
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:36 PM",No,Got the built in to work but I actually have to use it twice so idk if it ends up being faster than mine 
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:38 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:44 PM",No,Ugh I really just want to request another challenge instead of doing work
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 2:44 PM",No,But that seems like a bad idea
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,I think my pirates code is closer
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Close
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,But I kind of let it sprawl so it's hard to test well
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 8:28 PM",No,http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21699890-why-never-giving-up-worthwhile-goal-character-driven?fsrc=scn/fb/te/pe/ed/characterdriven
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:15 PM",No,Putting my dick in a rando from tinder
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:15 PM",No,She starts having her period on my bed
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:15 PM",No,
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,Omg
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:16 PM",No,She didn't know she was on her period
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,Asian girl?
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,Also dude i fucked up picking up a girl at the gym
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,Dif girl
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,Oh that's not very kosher
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,And what did you do Boyu 
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:30 PM",No,Lol passed up a prime chance to talk to her
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:30 PM",No,Talked to her for a little tho
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:30 PM",No,"You guys have weird ideas of ""fucking up"""
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:31 PM",No,Didn't set myself up
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:31 PM",No,For a date
18605603559,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:31 PM",No,she was interested
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:32 PM",No,Yeah that could have gone better
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:37 PM",No,I just threw out the whole blanket
18607168967,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:37 PM",No,I didn't like it anyway
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:58 PM",No,http://youtu.be/kpk2tdsPh0A
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:58 PM",No,Some people are really into Mario 64
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:59 PM",No,Sorry about your blanket
18609676168,"Jun 5, 2016, 11:59 PM",No,Usually blood comes out in cold water tho
18607168967,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:13 AM",No,I think I legitimately have brain damage from all the drinking I did in the past 6 years
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 8:15 AM",No,That's a scary thought
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 10:10 AM",No,MIT course starts tomorrow
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 10:10 AM",No,I'm pumped
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 10:35 AM",No,Also I caved and requested the next foobar challenge
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 10:46 AM",Yes,IÍm pumped for the course too
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,Dude I just completed another challenge
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:30 AM",Yes,That fast?
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:30 AM",Yes,Nice
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,I was on a boring phone call
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,I'm on to level 3
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:30 AM",Yes,Killing it
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,Also I got an invite link for a friend
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,Do you want it?
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:31 AM",Yes,Sure
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,Just sent it to you over fb
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,Also as an FYI they are using Python 2.7 not 3.5
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:00 PM",Yes,how does that affect me
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,Watch out for the range and print functions and integer division
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,It's a pretty small list of changes
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:01 PM",Yes,ok
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,But you might want to download Python 2 on your computer so you can make sure you're doing the right thing
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Also there may be different modules available 
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:06 PM",Yes,k got 2.7
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:06 PM",Yes,i wonÍt have time to write this code until like 6 though
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,Well you have 2 days so that's fine
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:08 PM",No,None of the time limits have been scary yet
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:09 PM",Yes,I like the countdown on the screen
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:12 PM",No,Yeah I'm sure that gets less fun when you're close to getting ducked 
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:28 PM",Yes,How would you do the pirate one? I'm thinking make a second list and marking places with a 1 in list 2 once they've been hit until you find a place that gets hit twice. Then count from that position until it gets back to that position 
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:28 PM",Yes,But that seems inefficient 
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,That was basically what I was thinking too
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,"There's only 5000 pirates so at absolute worst you'd travel 10,000 steps in your loop"
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,Which isn't great but if the steps inside are small shouldn't be bad either
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:30 PM",Yes,I don't know some stuff about lists in Python
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:31 PM",Yes,Do I need to initialize my second list to be the same size as my input list or can I just start writing to like spot 20 in an empty list
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:31 PM",No,You can't write to spot 20
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:31 PM",No,You'll get an index error
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:31 PM",No,But you can usually just append as you go
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:32 PM",No,That's actually something I've been trying to do better
18607168967,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,So that asian girl found out I was jewish at the end of our date and I don't think she's okay with that
18607168967,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,Wtf Midwest
18607168967,"Jun 6, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,(Slash China)
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:02 PM",No,Lol that's so weird
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:38 PM",No,I got another challenge and this one seems decently legit hard
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:40 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,This is obviously something Google actually had to figure out at some point
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,I have some ideas although having 100 search terms might be insane
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:45 PM",Yes,Oh that looks fun
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:47 PM",Yes,What I meant with the list thing is I wouldnÍt just append the list. Like if my input list is 80 terms I would make a second list of 80 zeroes and then change each position to a 1 as it got hit. So if spot 0 directed to spot 74 then I would write spot 74 of my new list to a 1
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,I have two ideas 
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,"Yeah I understand that idea, I think there's probabaly just a way that doesn't end up needing to create as large of a list through just appending"
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:50 PM",Yes,Meaning?
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,But if you want to do that then you would need to prepopulate the list
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,Just make sure you understand the idea of pointers when you're populating that list
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:50 PM",Yes,I donÍt know how to do it through appending
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:51 PM",Yes,Because if I just appended 74 then I would then need to check if 74 was anywhere in the list
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:51 PM",Yes,Which would take more processing than the other way
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,Like just create a new list of lists with each Sublist having two elements
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",No,"One as a counter, the other as the position "
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",Yes,I was just going to create a 1 element list
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",No,Actually you don't need a counter
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",No,So yeah 1 element list would be fine
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",Yes,list2(74)=1
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",Yes,etc
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",No,Don't even bother setting it to 1 in your new list
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:52 PM",No,Just see if it exists
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:53 PM",Yes,word
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:53 PM",Yes,like if list(74)=true?
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:53 PM",Yes,Anyways
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:53 PM",Yes,What are your 2 ideas
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:59 PM",No,"Just have a list, with each value being a position"
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 1:59 PM",No,And then a statement like if position is in list
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,Anyways my first idea is to break up the starting document into chunks
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,And some of the chunks would need to overlap
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,And then test each chunk to see if it had the words
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,And iteratively reduce the size of the chunks that still have the words
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:01 PM",Yes,Sounds like a lot of processing
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:02 PM",Yes,But my only idea would be to start counting at each word in your list until you found all words
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,The other idea was to assign each word it's position as a value in a dictionary and then look at all possible combinations of those words and find the one with the minimum difference between its largest position and smallest
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:02 PM",Yes,And then find the shortest number of words
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:03 PM",Yes,Not sure I fully get that
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:03 PM",Yes,if your words were like ñgoing to the storeî
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,Like each word in the document
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,Not in the search terms
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:04 PM",Yes,But when would you find the search terms
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,When you're building your possibility list
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,Again potentially a lot of processing
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:05 PM",No,Honesty a better idea and maybe this is what yours was
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:06 PM",No,Would be to start at the top of the document and keep going till you've find all the search terms
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:06 PM",No,See how long that is
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:06 PM",Yes,Then start with the second search term and redo that same thing
18607168967,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:06 PM",No,Nobody is texting me back
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:06 PM",No,Then start after where you found the first search term and go for however long you previously found
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:06 PM",Yes,Yeah
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:07 PM",No,I'm just not positive I've fully thought out how duplicate words would work
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:07 PM",Yes,when youÍre making a function with a list input is it def answer(numbers): or is it def answer(numbers[])
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,"Like if your terms were ""the, world, hi"" you obviously want the second the in the phrase ""the guy said to the world hi"""
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,So I don't think you could start searching at the second term
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,I think you could start searching after the first term tho
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:08 PM",Yes,I meant second term in the document. So first youÍd do the first the and then 2nd the and then world
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,Okay yeah
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,"Also remind me to never use the word ""the"" as an example when trying to explain anything"
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,You also would only have to search as far forward as your best length so far
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,Which seems like a huge plus
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,But I feel like there's an optimization if you first could figure out where to start searching
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:12 PM",No,Like it's unlikely that you should actually start searching at the first word
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,"Like what if you first broke the document up by tenths and just measured which three consecutive tenths had the highest occurrence of your search terms, surely you should start where your search terms are highest"
18609894948,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:18 PM",Yes,That would make it weird when you had strings of search terms across tenths
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:28 PM",No,So yeah that's why you'd look at groups of consecutive tenths and it's only a place to start searching 
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,It is a little bit of extra processing up front but it also seems like it's a lot more likely to get you at the right starting point
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:52 PM",No,Although the document is only 500 words long so maybe starting point doesn't matter that much?
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 2:53 PM",No,Anyways I found a module that lets you do speed/efficiency testing so I could see if it's more efficient
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 6:23 PM",No,440 new hires for June
18607168967,"Jun 6, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,Law school is stupid I think
18609676168,"Jun 6, 2016, 7:33 PM",No,Yeah? Why's that?
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:31 AM",No,Holy shit
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:32 AM",No,A deer ran into the car in front of me and died
18607168967,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:44 AM",No,Holy shit that's buts
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:58 AM",No,I don't know if I've ever seen a creature that large die before
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:59 AM",No,Anyways
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:59 AM",No,David have you started to get homework yet?
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 10:19 AM",No,Class started!!!!
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 4:14 PM",No,Just got a new werk laptop
18607168967,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:15 PM",No,I can't do dips at my gym. Any suggestions for a good Tri exercise?
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:19 PM",No,Close hand bench press or the thing with the cable/rope thing that you pull on
18607168967,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,Only barbells up to 25 lbs
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,Dumbbell behind the back tricep extensions as well
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,Also why are you at a gym that only has barbells up to 25?
18607168967,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,Probably liability?
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 9:31 PM",No,Find a new gym?
18607168967,"Jun 7, 2016, 10:03 PM",No,I asked the yale girl if I could fly her out to michigan
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 10:07 PM",No,lol yeah?
18607168967,"Jun 7, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,It's casual
18605603559,"Jun 7, 2016, 10:18 PM",No,Which yale girl?
18607168967,"Jun 7, 2016, 10:18 PM",No,The one Brian matched
18605603559,"Jun 7, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,Lol wtf
18605603559,"Jun 7, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,You still talking to her?
18609676168,"Jun 7, 2016, 11:59 PM",No,I watched the first lecture/did problem set 0
18609676168,"Jun 8, 2016, 2:42 PM",No,Finished lecture 2 for week1
18609676168,"Jun 8, 2016, 6:19 PM",No,"I feel like this is going to be a very thorough/academic course, we didn't get very far but I feel like I'm learning fundamentals that I haven't picked up yet"
18607168967,"Jun 9, 2016, 10:42 AM",No,Don't argue about the rules of civil procedure with tr guy who wrote the rules even if his interpretation is stupid
18607168967,"Jun 9, 2016, 4:13 PM",No,The kids here are mostly a step down from college
18609894948,"Jun 9, 2016, 4:38 PM",Yes,Worst fight of the year today
18609894948,"Jun 9, 2016, 4:38 PM",Yes,During the last day of lunch
18609676168,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:02 PM",No,Did you win?
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:03 PM",No,Yo
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,I have to retake two exams
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,The amount of effort I've put into the last part of the year is so bad
18607168967,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:05 PM",No,You failed two exams?
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:05 PM",No,Ya
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:05 PM",No,There's no repercussion tho
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:07 PM",No,I kinda took school very lightly
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:07 PM",No,And went through the exam maybe too quickly haha
18609676168,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:15 PM",No,What have you been up to then?
18605603559,"Jun 9, 2016, 5:26 PM",No,Volleyball
18609676168,"Jun 9, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 9, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 9, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,I got a solution but it keeps saying time limit exceeded 
18609676168,"Jun 9, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,"And I'm pretty sure it's because I used a brute force solution but I'm not sure what a ""smart solution"""
18609676168,"Jun 10, 2016, 12:19 PM",No,Lol Katie Li got into Harvards mph
18609676168,"Jun 10, 2016, 12:19 PM",No,Program 
18605603559,"Jun 10, 2016, 12:22 PM",No,Lol she's still dating someone right?
18609676168,"Jun 10, 2016, 12:23 PM",No, Yeah
18605603559,"Jun 10, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,Dude she's nuts lol
18609676168,"Jun 10, 2016, 1:11 PM",No,Lol yeah
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 12:19 PM",No,Lol one of my friends got a $430 ticket last night
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,That sucks. Why?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 12:53 PM",No,He jumped the fence and ran around the baseball field and then slid into home
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 12:54 PM",No,Annie hasn't texted me back :(
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:11 PM",Yes,Thats hilarious
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:37 PM",No,I re-did my solution using a different method but now it's giving new memoryerror
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:38 PM",Yes,What error
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:53 PM",No,
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:53 PM",Yes,weird 
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:53 PM",No,Means some overflow probs
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:53 PM",No,Like you have an infinite loop
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:53 PM",No,I think it's because my new solution could make a lot of arrays
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:53 PM",No,And it counts too high
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:54 PM",No,I don't think it's infinite
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:54 PM",Yes,I think infinite loop would just give time limit exceeded
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:54 PM",No,Python integers max out at like 32 billion or something
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:54 PM",No,But it could very well just have too many elements in an array
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:54 PM",No,But I'm pretty sure it's finite
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:55 PM",No,Finding the best path through a 20x20 grid is just fucking hard tho
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,No dude
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,You just have to write a recursive algorithm
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,It's like 4 lines
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,We did it in class
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,Maybe in perl
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,You just have to think about it the right way
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,Thanks for your useless truisms 
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:07 PM",No,Not worthless
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:07 PM",No,When you have reached the destination you terminate
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:07 PM",No,"When you haven't, you iterate"
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,In all directions
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,"And if you are at a place you have been to before, you terminate"
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:08 PM",Yes,It doesnÍt really work for this problem
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,I haven't read the problem
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,"(My bad, I just thought the difficulty was finding a best path in a grid)"
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:09 PM",Yes,Because your goal is to navigate the maze using exactly a certain amount of resources
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:09 PM",Yes,So sometimes you want to use more and sometimes less
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:09 PM",Yes,So there arenÍt necessarily intermediate goals
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,"The goal is to find the best path, the problem is that it's really hard to know if you've found it without iterating over many many paths"
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:26 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:26 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,Basically my plan is to take the starting position and then create new positions (in the list of positions to check) in each possible legal direction and then remove the original position from the list of positions to check
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:57 PM",Yes,Do they let you import stuff?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:57 PM",No,Some stuff
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:57 PM",Yes,Because I just solved my problem by importing a function that basically solved it
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,It's in the constraints of which modules are allowed
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,I currently am importing other tools and operator
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,Although I think my latest revision no longer uses either
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:59 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:59 PM",Yes,What does that mean
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,You tried to call something that doesn't exist
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:00 PM",Yes,So if thatÍs the line I stole
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:00 PM",Yes,Then it probably wonÍt work?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:00 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,Probs not? Did you make sure to include your import statements?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,I've used itertools in one of mine
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:01 PM",Yes,It works in my shell
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,Hmm
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,What's the *test mean?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:02 PM",Yes,I guess I am using 2.7.11 and they are using 2.7.6
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:02 PM",Yes,If that changes anything
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,Really shouldn't 
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:02 PM",Yes,YouÍre right that should read words
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:02 PM",Yes,ThatÍs probably it
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:02 PM",Yes,It was because I was naming my list test
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:03 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,Well
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,It ran
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:03 PM",Yes,Oh
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:03 PM",Yes,IÍm supposed to print a string not a list
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,Oh that's not too tough to fix
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:05 PM",Yes,hmm
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:05 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:06 PM",No,Edge cases
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:06 PM",No,What's the problem statement again?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:06 PM",Yes,They give you a list of words in alphabetical order (of some language not english)
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:06 PM",Yes,You print out a string in alphabetical order
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:07 PM",No,Is it all lowercase/how do they handle special characters?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:07 PM",Yes,all lowercase all letters
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:08 PM",Yes,Oh
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:08 PM",Yes,It just doesnÍt work
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:08 PM",Yes,What I wrote
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:09 PM",Yes,Hmm
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:09 PM",Yes,This is a lot harder than I realized
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:11 PM",Yes,"Do you have any idea how to take a list of lists([1,2,4],[4,5,7],[3,6]) and print out the first item of each list and then the second and then the third (so [1,4,3,2,5,6,4,7])"
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:11 PM",Yes,Right now thatÍs what my import is doing
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:12 PM",Yes,But I need to be able to remove words once I get the first alphabetically determining digit from them
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:17 PM",No,If you had nested for loops
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:17 PM",No,And use one of the for loops for the index 
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:18 PM",No,And another for the sublist
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:20 PM",No,For I in range(3):\LF   For list in lists:\LF        New list.append(list(I))
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:46 PM",Yes,Why doesnÍt this work
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:46 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:47 PM",Yes,"I would expect a,c,e"
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,My guess is that when you're removing the word you're screwing up the for loop somehow
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,Like you're making it misstep or something
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,What happens when you debug it ?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:52 PM",Yes,It doesnÍt matter anyways
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:52 PM",Yes,My plan doesnÍt work
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:53 PM",Yes,My plan was go through all the first letters and if they werenÍt on the list add them to the list
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:53 PM",Yes,And then go through all the second letters
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:53 PM",Yes,etc
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:53 PM",Yes,But the second letters might fit somewhere between the first letters on the alphabetical list
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:53 PM",No,That's true
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:54 PM",Yes,This seems like it should be easy
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:54 PM",Yes,But IÍm struggling to figure out how to do it
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 3:56 PM",No,Have you considered converting everything to numbers and sorting that way?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:05 PM",Yes,Even so
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:08 PM",Yes,"LetÍs say my words are (aac, abc, azg, cab, zgh). I can go through all my first letters and get ñaczî. Then I can go through my second letters and get b is after a and before z. But I donÍt know where to add it to my list in relation to c"
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:09 PM",Yes,So I could give them all numbers but would I just give b and c the same number?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:09 PM",Yes,And it gets more complicated with more letters
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:15 PM",No,You'd give b 2 and c 3
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:15 PM",No,And you'd just go through the list until you got to a number larger than yours and then your just insert before that position
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:20 PM",Yes, How do you know b is lower than c
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:45 PM",No,Because 2 is less than 3
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:45 PM",No,You need a mapping function to map letters to values
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:46 PM",No,But there's some built in
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:47 PM",Yes,No
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:48 PM",Yes,There's no reason from that list I gave you that you could possibly know whether b or c comes first alphabetically
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:49 PM",Yes,You know a<c<z and you know a<b<z
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 4:49 PM",Yes,But you know nothing about a vs b
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:22 PM",No,Can you send me the full problem statement? I think I'm missing something
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:22 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:27 PM",No,Hogg
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:27 PM",No,Ohh*
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:27 PM",No,That is very tricky
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:29 PM",No,Because you could have many bits of inconclusive data
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:32 PM",No,Maybe you could have a list of list where the outer list is essentially an index of all the different positions that you have some information about
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:32 PM",No,And then the inner list has all of the letters that could be at that's relative position
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:33 PM",No,Like if you knew x<a<z and x<b<z
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:33 PM",Yes,Theres no way I have the knowledge to write that
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:33 PM",No,"Then X would be at position 0, a and b would be at position 1 and z would be at position 2"
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:34 PM",No,I'm not exactly sure how you'd go about updating that list tho
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:43 PM",Yes,I donÍt think I can do this one
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:51 PM",No,You might have to do some learning first
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:53 PM",No,See if you can find some slides on advanced sorting methods or something
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:53 PM",Yes,did you know freeze mage canÍt deal with malygos
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:53 PM",Yes,thats what i learned
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:59 PM",No,Malygos?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:59 PM",No,Can't it still just kill you
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 6:59 PM",Yes,not if youÍve used fireballs on violet teachers and gadgetzens 
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:00 PM",Yes,when every card in your deck is a win condition
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:00 PM",Yes,how can you lose
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:03 PM",No,Sounds like they just don't know how to play freeze Mage
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:03 PM",Yes,they had gold mage and legend back
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:04 PM",Yes,i had a lot of pressure though
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:04 PM",Yes,ramp and threats
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:07 PM",No,Ah
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:07 PM",Yes,honestly the deck i posted is legit good
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:07 PM",Yes,climbed 19 to 12 today
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:11 PM",No,I'm going try this veggie protein
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:11 PM",Yes,why
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:12 PM",No,
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:12 PM",Yes,is it soy
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:16 PM",No,I don't think so?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:16 PM",No,But not sure
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:17 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:18 PM",No,I think it's mostly from this:sacha inchi seed
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:19 PM",Yes,huh
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:19 PM",Yes,whyÍd you decide on this
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:21 PM",No,They had samples at Costco
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:21 PM",No,And it tasted pretty good
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:21 PM",No,Although they made it with almond milk
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:21 PM",Yes,sounds very basic
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:22 PM",No,Yes
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:25 PM",No,I feel like it might be good for you tho
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:25 PM",No,Because protein powder usually has a ton of protein but also usually a lot of cholesterol and is from kind of weird sources
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:26 PM",Yes,My brother was of the opinion that soy protein powder went right through you
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:26 PM",Yes,Not sure why though
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:35 PM",No,Huh idk
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:35 PM",No,Anyways I finally got this new solution to work but I'm still hitting time limit exceeded
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:36 PM",Yes,is it still taking years to complete
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:36 PM",No,It runs 10X10 basically instantly now
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:36 PM",Yes,20x20?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:37 PM",No,I'm trying 14x14 now
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:37 PM",No,And it's been about a minute
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:37 PM",Yes,20x20 should take double as long right?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:38 PM",No,I'd guess even longer
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:38 PM",No,I feel like number of paths goes up really fast
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:38 PM",Yes,yeah i guess it probably doesnÍt scale linearly with area
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:39 PM",No,Lololol
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:39 PM",No,I almost hacked my way there
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:39 PM",Yes,how
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:39 PM",No,Just by saying if N>=14 assume that you won't get through
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:39 PM",Yes,haha
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:39 PM",No,And then the rest of my algorithm
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:39 PM",No,Passed 4/5 cases
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:40 PM",Yes,you start with 200 food right?
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:40 PM",Yes,so theres only 201 possible answers
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:40 PM",Yes,you should just return numbers between -1 and 200 until you get the 5th case
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:40 PM",Yes,and then add that to your function
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:40 PM",No,Up to 200
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:41 PM",Yes,yeah just write a function that returns a number and test it until you figure it out
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:41 PM",No,Yeah I could do that
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:41 PM",No,I'm currently just slowly incrementimg up my cutoff
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:41 PM",No,So I'm up to N>=16
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:42 PM",No,With the hopes that the last case is computable 
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:42 PM",Yes,and youÍre not getting time limit exceeded?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:43 PM",No,I just ran it for N=17 and it didn't hit time
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:43 PM",No,Same for N=20
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:43 PM",No,18*
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,Fuck I got all the way up to 19 and it's still failing the fifth case
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:45 PM",Yes,but it only exceeds time limit on 20?
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,Yeah 
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,Blargh
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:45 PM",Yes,did you retry 20
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,Yeah a bunch haha
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:45 PM",Yes,just keep trying
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:46 PM",No,I could just guess and check for the fifth case
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:46 PM",No,But Jesus that's not satisfying
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:46 PM",Yes,i guess you know that its 20 now
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:46 PM",No,Yes.. But I don't know what to do with that haha
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:46 PM",Yes,well it makes it easy to guess and check
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:47 PM",No,That's true
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:47 PM",Yes,can you think of any minor optimizations
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:48 PM",No,Yeah some and that's probs what I should be doing
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,Girl won't text md back
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,And I called
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,No answer
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:55 PM",No,I had high hopes
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:55 PM",Yes,hows the making friends process going
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,I have like one friend
18607168967,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:58 PM",No,Maybe 2
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:59 PM",Yes,well 
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 7:59 PM",Yes,thats something
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,Yeah I would try to build up a solid friend base
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 8:12 PM",No,School and girls are going to fluctuate so you'll want something solid to fall back on
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 8:13 PM",Yes,The US just got a red card
18609894948,"Jun 11, 2016, 8:13 PM",Yes,fucking brilliant
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 11:21 PM",No,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0ei2h-0QDU
18609676168,"Jun 11, 2016, 11:21 PM",No,Trump university infomercial
18605603559,"Jun 12, 2016, 12:17 AM",No,Dude Brian didn't tell me this girl I wanted to hook up with came over hammered
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 12:20 AM",Yes,lol sheÍs been hooking up with brian alvarado
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 12:20 AM",Yes,donÍt tell him i told you
18605603559,"Jun 12, 2016, 12:20 AM",No,Kate?
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 12:20 AM",Yes,no
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 12:20 AM",Yes,krystal
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 11:08 AM",Yes,you guys seeing this shit in orlando
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,Holy shit
18607168967,"Jun 12, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,It's not on Redford front page
18607168967,"Jun 12, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,What the fuck
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 11:24 AM",Yes,It was
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 11:24 AM",Yes,Then the thread got deleted
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 11:26 AM",Yes,Some kind of shit went down on the news subreddit
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:02 PM",No,I was able to get my test time per loop down from 6.75 ms to 6.04ms but I'm still hitting timelimit
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:03 PM",Yes,ThatÍs frustrating
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:03 PM",Yes,I gave up on mine
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:04 PM",No,Granted I'm doing tests on a 7x7 grid
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:04 PM",No,And my computer is a fucking animal but still 
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:07 PM",Yes,well
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:08 PM",No,Also I'm breaking a lot of good code practices (mostly modularization and readability) to get it to run faster
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:11 PM",No,Well I'm down from 5 functions to 1 and I'm down to 4.86 ms per loop
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:14 PM",No,It might be time for guess and check
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:14 PM",No,I know solution 5 is the only one with N=20
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:14 PM",No,And it's the one I'm failing on
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:14 PM",No,Test 5*
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,3.6ms and still time error
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:24 PM",No,Still fucking exceeding the timelimit
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,Well my code actually evaluates 20x20 grids fast on my own computer now
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:16 PM",No,Finally got it
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:16 PM",Yes,The real way?

18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:16 PM",No,I tried for quite a while to figure out a way to extract the test cases but couldn't get that to work
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:17 PM",No,It doesn't support the email module
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:18 PM",Yes,So you did guess and check?
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:18 PM",No,I'm taking a break before the next one
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:18 PM",Yes,Solve mine
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:19 PM",No,Yeah I did
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:19 PM",No,Turns out the answer to the fifth case was 48
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:19 PM",Yes,Good to know
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:24 PM",No,Yours also sounds hard
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:32 PM",No,I haven't even looked at the problem set for the MIT class yet
18609894948,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:33 PM",Yes,Same
18609676168,"Jun 12, 2016, 3:34 PM",No,I told my TL at work that once one of my customers goes live I want to put that time towards development work
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 2:50 PM",No,We had a prac test today to get a taste of what it was like
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,It didn't matter and he doesn't know who wrote what
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,But I could have done better
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,There was an issue I spotted but forgot to write
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,Blegh

18605603559,"Jun 13, 2016, 11:01 PM",No,If you're at 4 percent you're ill
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,Or Apollo Ono
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,I think he may have even been at 3
18605603559,"Jun 13, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,He was probably anemic
18607168967,"Jun 13, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,Isn't like 9.5 not even healthy though
18605603559,"Jun 13, 2016, 11:02 PM",No,Uh it's really healthy

18605603559,"Jun 14, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,that's so much better than having to plan an hour lesson and teach high school kids from Hartford who don't give a shit
18605603559,"Jun 14, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,And are rowdy
18609894948,"Jun 14, 2016, 5:11 PM",Yes,Welcome to my life

18605603559,"Jun 17, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,Lol nah
18605603559,"Jun 17, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,300k working 3 days a week
18605603559,"Jun 17, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,I'd take it
18609676168,"Jun 17, 2016, 3:37 PM",No,Yeah you've told us haha
18609676168,"Jun 17, 2016, 3:41 PM",No,I think you're making some upper 10th percentile projections and treating them as median
18609894948,"Jun 17, 2016, 3:41 PM",Yes,Yeah the average pediatric dentist makes 150
18609894948,"Jun 17, 2016, 3:41 PM",Yes,I looked it up
18609676168,"Jun 17, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,And I'm guessing that's not 3 days a week
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:06 PM",Yes,Did you do this weekÍs riddler
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:17 PM",Yes,ItÍs easy to monte carlo
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:18 PM",Yes,I found a calculus solution online that got the same answer
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:20 PM",No,I feel like I could setup a calc solution easier than Monte Carlo?
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:21 PM",No,I'm just looking at it now
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:21 PM",Yes,Really?
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:21 PM",Yes,It seems complicated in reading the solution
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:21 PM",Yes,(I found the same question on Cal PolyÍs website w/ solution)
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:21 PM",Yes,But by all means try it
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:21 PM",No,Maybe not then
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:22 PM",No,Yeah nvm
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:23 PM",No,"My first thought was that the ""edible"" part would be perfectly square but I don't think that's true anymore"
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:23 PM",Yes,No
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:23 PM",Yes,I think the key to calculus is this part
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:23 PM",No,Anyways Monte Carlo seems easy enough if you just make a large grid and then do distance formula vs closest edge
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:24 PM",Yes,"ñChoose units and a cartesian coordinate system so that the square has vertices at the four points whose x and y coordinates are ±1. By symmetry we may assume the dart lands in that triangle with vertices (0,0), (-1,1), (1,1). Here the closest edge for any point is the top edge.î"
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:27 PM",No,What do you think intuitively is the most efficient shape? My guess is circle
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:28 PM",Yes,ItÍs a parabola
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:28 PM",Yes,Of some sort
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,The most efficient sand which shape?
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:31 PM",Yes,Oh
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:31 PM",Yes,I didnÍt do that
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:31 PM",Yes,circle seems right
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:31 PM",Yes,because it would be along the radius
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:31 PM",Yes,so it wold be 50% yeah?
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:33 PM",No,Well it would be an inner circle with 50% of the radius so 25%?
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:33 PM",Yes,oh
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:34 PM",Yes,good point
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:34 PM",Yes,interesting
18609894948,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:34 PM",Yes,a square was still 22%
18609676168,"Jun 18, 2016, 4:34 PM",No,Not bad
18607168967,"Jun 18, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,If the average person spends 5 minutes deciding what to watch on Netflix per week
18607168967,"Jun 18, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,And they have 60 million subscribers
18607168967,"Jun 18, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,That's 5 million hours
18607168967,"Jun 18, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,Over 500 human years per week
18607168967,"Jun 18, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,7 full liftemes
18607168967,"Jun 18, 2016, 8:24 PM",No,How crazy is that
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:45 AM",No,I hate like all of the girls I've gone on dates with here
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:16 PM",Yes,Finished problem set 1
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:17 PM",No,Nice
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:17 PM",Yes,I kinda cheated on the last one
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:17 PM",No,I've been doing work/watching the league in the background 
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:18 PM",Yes,"Noticed that in the string ñhamburger, salad, waterî the first letter of each word is the only time that letter appears so you can just count those letters"
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:18 PM",No,I haven't looked at it yet
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:18 PM",No,Also tell your brother happy birthday
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:18 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:19 PM",No,Fathers day***
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:19 PM",Yes,Tell my brother?
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:19 PM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:19 PM",Yes,As far as he knows heÍs not a father
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:19 PM",Yes,I think
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:20 PM",Yes,Have you been doing the problems in lecture sequences?
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:20 PM",Yes,/are those graded?
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:24 PM",No,Yes and yes 
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:39 PM",No,How long did the pset take you?
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:41 PM",Yes,15 minutes?
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:41 PM",Yes,I did the second problem pretty weird though
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:41 PM",Yes,"IÍll show you my code after you have a look at it, IÍm sure youÍll do it differently"
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:46 PM",No,Oh cool
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:46 PM",No,Sounds good
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,Are you using canopy?
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:48 PM",Yes,WhatÍs that
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,Another IDE
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,Has a bunch more built in features 
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:48 PM",Yes,Other than idle?
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:49 PM",No,Think about editing coding in text vs epic studio (although not nearly that pronounced)
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:49 PM",Yes,Honestly I just wrote the code in the space the problem gave you for this one
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:49 PM",Yes,I had to do like 2 or 3 checks per problem to fix small mistakes
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:49 PM",Yes,Mainly forgetting to put letters in parenthesis when checking for them
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:53 PM",No,That's not bad
18609894948,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:54 PM",Yes,But IÍm sure they will get harder
18609676168,"Jun 19, 2016, 4:55 PM",No,Yeah same
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:15 PM",No,Omg this game though
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,Nobody has scored in 3 minutes
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,Including a missed layup by James
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,And a missed open 3 by curry
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Does anybody want to win?
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,It's choke city
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:29 PM",No,That block!!!
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,King James is dead
18607168967,"Jun 19, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,I think 4 points were scored in the last 5 minutes
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 1:06 AM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 1:07 AM",No,I tried to keep it actually generalizable 
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 1:08 AM",No,I could have probably made the search parameters more generalizable so you wouldn't have to keep updating indices and just used length instead but oh well
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:17 AM",Yes,lol just look how i did it
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:17 AM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:18 AM",Yes,And for the one before:
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:18 AM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:37 AM",No,That looks pretty janky
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:44 AM",No,Do you know if you need to do anything to submit the pset besides just checking the answers and having them show as correct?
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:44 AM",Yes,No thatÍs it
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:44 AM",Yes,ThereÍs a grades page somewhere
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:44 AM",No,
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:45 AM",Yes,slice doesnÍt even do everything
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:45 AM",Yes,anything*
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:45 AM",No,Yeah I forgot to take that out 
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:46 AM",Yes,I didnÍt know how to look at multiple things in the for loop without indices
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:46 AM",Yes,I also didnÍt know if youÍd get out of bounds errors with code like that
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:46 AM",Yes,For the last couple letters
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,I used indices
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,And I just made sure that it would go 2 less times than the length of the string
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:46 AM",Yes,Oh and len -2
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:47 AM",Yes,Yeah I thought about that
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:47 AM",Yes,I like my way haha
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:47 AM",Yes,ItÍs creative
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:47 AM",No,TRUE
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:47 AM",No,But is it pythonic?
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:49 AM",No,http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:50 AM",Yes,That looks long
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:51 AM",No,Yeah don't read it
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:51 AM",No,"But in general try to make your code clear, generalizable and modularizable "
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:52 AM",Yes,My menu item code was generalible
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:52 AM",Yes,It just could be fucked up easily
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:52 AM",No,What if a word didn't have any unique characters in the string
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:52 AM",No,That's a gigantic edge case
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:52 AM",Yes,Well it wasnÍt an issue 
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,Not yet 
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:54 AM",No,That kind of methodology is going to get you ducked when you can't see all the test inputs tho
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:54 AM",Yes,Well I wouldnÍt have written it that way if I didnÍt know it would work
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:55 AM",Yes,Are you using canopy?
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,Sometimes
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,Not for this one
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:00 PM",No,Pset 2 also looks pretty easy
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:00 PM",Yes,Doing the lectures
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:00 PM",Yes,Right now
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,Nice
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,2 more lectures and another problem set are released tomorrow
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:07 PM",No,Judy is giving an insane speech on how company acquisitions literally always fail
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:07 PM",No,Can someone let Bain Capital know?
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,Now she's pitching specialist training specialist and dismissing customers concerns of that its too expensive
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,"And she's showing us some rough math, but it totally fails to include opportunity cost of the specialist trainers"
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:34 PM",No,I'm really wondering if she made a stupid mistake or if she thought we wouldn't notice
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:48 PM",No,Raise your hand and point it out (lol)
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:51 PM",No,That would be interesting
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:51 PM",No,People have done that a couple of times
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:55 PM",Yes,Did you do L3 problem 9?
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:55 PM",Yes,It took me a long time because of stupid semantics and exact matching their output
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:56 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:57 PM",Yes,It needed to be like this to get the rounding of ints correctly matching theirs:
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 12:57 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,I have not yet
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:07 PM",No,We had a prac exam grades out of 5
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:07 PM",No,I got a 5
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,(He didn't say how many people got what though)
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:10 PM",No,Nice!
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:26 PM",Yes,On pset 2 prob 2 make sure you read the part where they round up all numbers to the nearest 10
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:26 PM",Yes,Otherwise you sit for 20 minutes wondering why your code doesnÍt work
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:31 PM",No,Lolol
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:31 PM",No,I did actually take note of that
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:32 PM",Yes,I guess they wanted you to make guesses in multiples of 10
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:32 PM",Yes,I didnÍt do that and then just rounded at the end
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:32 PM",Yes,The whole point of the next question is how my way takes too much time
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:32 PM",Yes,Whoops
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:34 PM",Yes,Anyways get at me
18609894948,"Jun 20, 2016, 3:34 PM",Yes,
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 4:09 PM",No,Law school is dumb
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,A lot of kids didn't take subjects where there are right and wrong answers or even right and wrong ways to think about things 
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,So they just don't understand that they can be wrong
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,And there is no convincing them they are wrong because they can't understand that concept
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 5:21 PM",No,"@brian nice work, where'd you find that report?"
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 5:21 PM",No,"@David, it does beg the question of if there is actually right and wrong in law school?"
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 5:26 PM",No,If law school is another subject that doesn't focus or prioritize on right/wrong then you may be focusing on the wrong metric
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 5:27 PM",No,If it does value it then you should have a good time sitting way above those kids on the grading curve
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:19 PM",No,Damn this dude that was in my EDI start class who dropped out to start a startup just got back to Madison after expanding to 5 more cities 
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:22 PM",No,He's looking to sell it in a year or two to fund another startup
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,That's dope
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,There is a thunderstorm in the distance here
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,It's really nice
18605603559,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,sup guys
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:42 PM",No,You've been quiet
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:43 PM",No,He figures that way he'll be able to start something a bit more technical as hell have the street chops
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:43 PM",No,What was this first startup?
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,Basically uber for housecleaning 
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,Street credit*
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,Haha there are 2 really big ones for that
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,Task rabbit
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,And one specifically for house cleaning
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,He's not selling his anytime soon
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,His thing is worth nothing
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,It's like handiman
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,The other one won techcrunch
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,*i think the other one is handiman
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,The play is just to get a big player to buy you out
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,Alfred
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,So they get regional dominance 
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,That's the name
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,And you walk away with a payday and on to the next one
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,Right but region stuff isn't the right way to think about apps that are national from day one
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,It's only thinking that has no place in the brave new world
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,Maybe he can convince some idiots to give him money
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,House cleaning isn't national tho
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,Telling them that will happen
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,As there's the whole trust and vetting thing that needs to happen city by city
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,"But what happens is that one apps success in a region, just primes people to want apps that do that"
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,So they will just adopt the national standard
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,Wait wait wait
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,You still need to essentially employ a workforce in each city
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,Is it an actual maid service or regular people paid to do it by the app?
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,The idea is the suppliers of the house cleaning would be people who essentially full time house clean
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,Homejoy is also there
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,Or at least that was the model in Madison 
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,This is a crowded crowded space
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,Your boy has no idea what he's up against
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,What's his app called?
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,Damn this dude that was in my EDI start class who dropped out to start a startup just got back to Madison after expanding to 5 more cities 
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,Oops
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,https://www.errund.com
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:50 PM",No,The labor markets aren't perfectly fluid between these services
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:50 PM",No,So there's regional viscosity
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:51 PM",No, Eh maybe dude
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,His thing is professional looking
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,I would try it
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,Does he have to pay a lot of insurance?
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,Also his families been in the cleaning business for at least a generation and I think they have ties
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:52 PM",No,Idk about insurance
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:52 PM",No,Probs some but if it's like renters insurance it's really cheep
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:52 PM",No,Oh well that's a big leg up probably
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:52 PM",No,I think there's kind of an Asian cleaning network too
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,And I think he still holds all the equity 
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,As he basically just spent all his salary from the time he was at epic in launching it
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,Handy has a 500mm valuation
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,That's a lot
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,That'd be sick if he could get bought by them 
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,Yeah dude
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,I need to get my ambition back
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,That's a good shot of becoming a millionaire in like 2 years
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:57 PM",No,If he pulls all of that off id seriously consider trying to get him to let me work in the next one
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:57 PM",No, Over Hbs? Bold but not the stupidest thing
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,Probs after or possibly concurrent
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,I hope I do well enough to transfer
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,Not saying I def would transfer
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,But it'd be nice to have the option
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,As one of our classes we have to create a startup
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,"Might as well try it on something ""real"""
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,I'm sure real startups come out of that class
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,It's hbs
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,Yeah that's also true
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:00 PM",No,
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:00 PM",No,This lighting is pretty cool
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,Yeah that's really interesting g
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,Flying through thunderstorms also looks wild
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,It's cooler in person
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,The camera didn't get it well
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,Makes sense
18607168967,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,It's been going for like 45 minutes
18609676168,"Jun 20, 2016, 10:07 PM",No,Nice
18609676168,"Jun 21, 2016, 1:00 PM",No,I'm really curious as to how the VCs will value Errund
18607168967,"Jun 21, 2016, 1:01 PM",No,They won't unless he raises money
18609676168,"Jun 21, 2016, 1:02 PM",No,He's going to the VCs to raise money
18609676168,"Jun 21, 2016, 1:04 PM",No,Or at least I think that's why he's meeting with them
18609894948,"Jun 21, 2016, 1:04 PM",Yes,They must have some interest if theyÍre meeting
18609676168,"Jun 21, 2016, 1:04 PM",No,In any case he does have revenue and growth so I'm not sure why VCs wouldn't value it
18609676168,"Jun 21, 2016, 1:18 PM",No,Anyways I think he's probably looking at a pretty large payout 3-4 years out of undergrad 
18609676168,"Jun 21, 2016, 2:12 PM",No,https://lists.linkedin.com/2016/top-attractors/en/us

18607168967,"Jun 21, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,No! Sergio is my favorite
18609894948,"Jun 21, 2016, 4:48 PM",Yes,It wasnÍt even poorly taken
18607168967,"Jun 21, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,He's probably the only guy on the team I still know
18609894948,"Jun 21, 2016, 4:48 PM",Yes,Goalkeeper guessed right and made a good save
18609894948,"Jun 21, 2016, 4:48 PM",Yes,IsnÍt Iniesta Spanish?

18605603559,"Jun 22, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,I'm at 9.1 percent body fat at 165
18605603559,"Jun 22, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,Leg strength coming back too
18605603559,"Jun 22, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,I need to get to 315 squat
18609894948,"Jun 22, 2016, 6:50 PM",Yes,Have you seen the Euro bracket David?
18609894948,"Jun 22, 2016, 6:50 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jun 22, 2016, 6:51 PM",Yes,"Germany, Italy, Spain, France, England all on the bottom half"
18609894948,"Jun 22, 2016, 6:51 PM",Yes,Portugal who havenÍt even won a game yet gets to be all alone on the top
18607168967,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:02 PM",No,Omg it's going to be sick!!!
18607168967,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:02 PM",No,I don't care about fairness
18607168967,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:02 PM",No,Lots of great games from the getgo 
18609894948,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:02 PM",Yes,Italy wins their group and gets Spain and then Germany
18607168967,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:02 PM",No,Plus Ronaldo against bad teams will be fun to watch
18607168967,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:02 PM",No,Total bullshit though if you are a fan of any of the teams
18607168967,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:03 PM",No,Except Portugal
18609894948,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:03 PM",Yes,Who had like the worst performance of any of them
18609894948,"Jun 22, 2016, 7:04 PM",Yes,If they had performed well they might be in IcelandÍs spot
18607168967,"Jun 23, 2016, 9:31 AM",No,Blargh. This one teacher I have is actually so bad
18609676168,"Jun 23, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,Oh god
18609676168,"Jun 23, 2016, 5:58 PM",No,I requested another foobar challenge
18609676168,"Jun 23, 2016, 5:58 PM",No,And it's cray cray
18609676168,"Jun 23, 2016, 6:02 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 23, 2016, 6:03 PM",No,I just don't remember math 
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:07 AM",No,So it's looks like Brexit
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:09 AM",No,Yeah dude
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:09 AM",No,Should have made all the money
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:10 AM",No,It was at 20% 3 days ago
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:10 AM",No,Motherfucker
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:11 AM",No,There's definitely still plenty of price action waiting to happen elsewhere
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:13 AM",No,I'm guessing US markets will have some sort of reaction
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:13 AM",No,And European ones definitely will
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:19 AM",No,Trump is still only at 86 for being the republican nominee
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:19 AM",No,How?
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:19 AM",No,Idk
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:19 AM",No,Just on the markets
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:20 AM",No,My best guess is that the market is just really illiquid so prices aren't accurate anymore
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,But it's a market
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,So people would just enter and buy
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,"Maybe they wouldn't sell, but they would buy cheap trump"
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,What if no one is selling
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,I think it's automatic 
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,Idk
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,I think it's automatic but I think it's still match making
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,Some of these kids are asdholes
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,I don't think the website is taking positional risk
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,They were being really homophobic
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,I'm not down for that post brown

18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:25 AM",No,Very low class
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:26 AM",No,These kids are just a dif social class than me
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:26 AM",No,Like all of them
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:26 AM",No,They are morons who dress like shit
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:27 AM",No,Michigan was a bold decision
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:28 AM",No,I think all of your options had pretty substantial risk attached one way or another
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:45 AM",No,Finally got another date 
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:45 AM",No,I need to fucking do well in law school
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:46 AM",No,So I can get a great job or transfer to Harvard
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:46 AM",No,Should I have columbia'd or Chicago'd
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:46 AM",No,I don't think so
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:46 AM",No,But ugh
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:55 AM",No,Also isadora ftw
18605603559,"Jun 24, 2016, 7:21 AM",No,Lol dude you realize how different a state school is compared to a private school only when you've gone to both
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 8:05 AM",Yes,Britains crazy
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:19 AM",Yes,"I'm thinking of doing 5x5 3 days a week, sprints one day and pull ups/upper body 1 day"
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:20 AM",Yes,Thoughts?
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:31 AM",No,I'd do the sprints and the pull ups on days you're already doing 5x5
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:31 AM",No,Or at least on the day that you don't have another day of 5x5 immediately after
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:34 AM",Yes,Hmm ok
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:34 AM",Yes,I was thinking about trying to do more than 3 days a week of work
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:34 AM",Yes,Given that I have lots of time
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:40 AM",No,I'd ease into it
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:43 AM",Yes,Word
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:43 AM",Yes,"Well either way, got my first good workout in a while in"
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:43 AM",Yes,Feels good
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:45 AM",No,If you want to spend more time at the gym I'd just fill it with mobility/flexibility stuff first
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:48 AM",No,And then once you've been excercising for a while you can ramp that frequency up
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,Or if you just start taking steroids you can workout as much as you want
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:49 AM",No,Anyways congrats
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 11:06 AM",Yes,Or I could just do it anyways and get injured
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,TRUE
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,I bought some loose leaf tea
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:02 PM",Yes,You need like a special thing to use that right?
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:05 PM",No,A ball thingy yeah
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:06 PM",Yes,Word
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:06 PM",Yes,Fancy
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:06 PM",No,Tasty too
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:35 PM",No,RBS and Barclays both dropped by ~20%
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:35 PM",Yes,Meh
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:35 PM",Yes,LetÍs look in a month
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,I'm honestly more curious about how their associate class sizes are doing than their stock price
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,There is going to be opprotunity to fucking crush it with this vote
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:36 PM",Yes,You should go to the Harvard Law meet up in Madison Adam
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,I don't go to Harvard law
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:36 PM",Yes,Oh lol the guy who posted it works at Epic and is friends with Sam
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:37 PM",No,Lololol
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:37 PM",No,Def not going
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:37 PM",No,And David crush what?
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:37 PM",Yes,Brian Yost
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:37 PM",No,Oh he quit epic already
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:38 PM",No,By crush it I mean maken20-40% in two weeks
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:39 PM",No,By speculating on the stock market
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:39 PM",Yes,Meh
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:39 PM",Yes,DoesnÍt seem like a great option for individuals without much money
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:39 PM",Yes,After trading fees and speculating when the drop is over I doubt youÍd make much if anything
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,I think you could make very high beta trades
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:41 PM",No,But I dont see much alpha
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,Although I think it might just be generally a good time to invest spare cash if you can afford to let it sit in an investment account
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:42 PM",Yes,I mean I feel like thats a good idea anytime
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,That's also true 
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 2:55 PM",No,Blargh. Went on a date with cute jewish girl
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 2:55 PM",Yes,Sounds shitty
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 2:55 PM",No,She said she's not interested because I remind her of an x
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,"(same voice, he was also going to be a patent lawyer)"
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,What a bitch
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 3:21 PM",No,The fucking bottom fell out of the market
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,I feel like if she's Jewish she should get used to dating lawyers
18607168967,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,Haha right?
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,So we changed one of the application names at Epic and we got some interesting comments on our user web 
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:13 PM",No,
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:21 PM",Yes,I mean theres plenty of apps that donÍt sound professional to work on
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:21 PM",Yes,Cupid comes to mind
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:22 PM",No,TRUE
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:23 PM",No,"It was previously ""Star"" and before that just ""Data warehouse"""
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 4:23 PM",Yes,It is a weird name
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,Did you guys do today's riddler?
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:41 PM",Yes,I want to write code for it
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:41 PM",Yes,I havenÍt yet though
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:42 PM",No,I haven't yet either
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,Pretty sure the crux is the intersection code
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:53 PM",Yes,Why does this not work for negative numbers?
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:53 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,What's it supposed to do?
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:54 PM",Yes,count the digits
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:54 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:55 PM",No,Because integer division rounds down
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:56 PM",No,FALSE
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:57 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:57 PM",Yes,gotcha
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,I think that might terminate early in some cases 
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,How does it deal with -10?
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",Yes,It doesnÍt in any of their test cases
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",Yes,Ah
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",Yes,YouÍre right
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:59 PM",Yes,How would you write it?
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 9:59 PM",No,Probably just make it positive from the start and then use your code
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:00 PM",Yes,Yeah that works
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:00 PM",Yes,Seems like cheating for some reason
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:01 PM",No,Or just treat the integer like a string and loop through its contents
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:01 PM",Yes,It wants you to use recursion
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:01 PM",Yes,And they give you a hint about dividing integers by 10
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:02 PM",No,I feel like you can turn loops into recursion relatively easily
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:02 PM",No,Although that hint definitely favors your approach
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:02 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",No,It would treat decimals/commas as digits currently
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,I thought about something like that for a hot sec
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,But it only takes in 1 parameter
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,x
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",No,That's fine
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",No,It runs
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,Oh 
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,I guess
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:10 PM",Yes,Not sure thatÍs whatÍs intended
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:10 PM",Yes,Wait donÍt you have to redefine x somewhere
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:10 PM",No,Yeah jk
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:11 PM",Yes,All you have to do is x=x[counter:]
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:11 PM",Yes,Or I guess x=x[1:]
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:12 PM",Yes,In digits
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:12 PM",Yes,digits
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:12 PM",Yes,ndigits
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:13 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:13 PM",No,Lol jk still doesny handle negatives
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:14 PM",No,Their - sign gets treated as a char
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:14 PM",Yes,Right
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:14 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:14 PM",No,Oh well I guess you just need some sort of check to see if you're dealing with a neg or positive
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:14 PM",Yes,This is pretty simple haha
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:14 PM",No,Or to use a different division function
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:14 PM",No,Something that always rounds towards 0
18609676168,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:15 PM",No,Or if we stop playing with recursion you just handle negatives/decimals then make it a string and then do len()
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:15 PM",Yes,I donÍt think theres a good way to do it
18609894948,"Jun 24, 2016, 10:16 PM",Yes,Like you could use floats and x<1 or x>-1

18609894948,"Jun 29, 2016, 11:14 AM",Yes,http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/29/tennis/sharapova-harvard-business-school/index.html
18609676168,"Jun 29, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,I think she might just be in the certificate program
18609676168,"Jun 29, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,Also David sent me another article on that topic and this was one of the comments:
18609676168,"Jun 29, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,Why not go to Trump U. Havard produced many of the idiots that came up with all the great mathematical calculations that produced the last recession. Should have their credentials downgraded.
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 1:55 PM",No,S&P 500 is almost back to where it was pre Brexit 
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,I told you that very limited value was actually destroyed
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,I should have purchased
18609894948,"Jun 30, 2016, 1:59 PM",Yes,I don't really get who sells when something like that happens
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 1:59 PM",No,You keep making statements that are based on the idea that you could time short term market fluctuations
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:01 PM",No,I think tons of people/institutional groups sell in any sort of macro panic event
18609894948,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:02 PM",Yes,Do they though
18609894948,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:02 PM",Yes,Like is that sound investing
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,No way they do
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,It's got to be all small time investors
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,Some institutional investors might be very risk adverse
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,Unless bad algorithms 
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:03 PM",No,Like fall this much in this time frame sell
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,Yeah there's definitely those as well
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,But I'm sure there's some funds where someone read the news at night and decided to sell at market open
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,"But anyways trying to time short term fluctuations generally seems like a losers game, especially without really good hardware to make sure HFTs aren't robbing you blind"
18609894948,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:22 PM",Yes,I agree I feel like with long term stuff like 2008 you can maybe time it (in the sense that you know the market is going back up eventually) but for short term shit by the time your sale or buy goes through its tough especially with fees
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:31 PM",No,Fees+front runners + it seems like even if you knew all the factors that you think should be affecting an asset's price that you wouldn't really know which of those factors actually makes each single person that currently holds the asset buy or sell
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 2:31 PM",No,Like those two hedge fund managers from the big short that successfully predicted a government coup but it didn't shift the exchange price at all
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:20 PM",No,I wonder how my vanguard funds are doing
18609894948,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:20 PM",Yes,luckily theres this place you can check
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:21 PM",No,"I checked my stocks yesterday, they fell but they recently rose so it's ok"
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:22 PM",No,Looks like I'm up 4.8% since last September
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,Which was the last time I did anything
18607168967,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,How do I restore deleted text messages?
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,I'm debating if/when I should take it out to pay for grad school
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:25 PM",No,I also really wish I knew the formula for how they calculate financial aid
18609894948,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:26 PM",Yes,http://www.hbs.edu/mba/financial-aid/domestic-students/Pages/need-based-fellowships.aspx
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:29 PM",No,It's deliberately vague 
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:29 PM",No,Like I can't actually calculate what they expect me to pay
18609894948,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:29 PM",Yes,You could email hbs and ask for any information/statistics they have on loans. I know hls gave a presentation that was relatively detailed for admitted students weekend
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:30 PM",No,Yeah I've asked before and they've basically told me to wait till once I've actually told them I was matriculating 
18609676168,"Jun 30, 2016, 5:30 PM",No,So I'll ask again this fall
18605603559,"Jul 1, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,Lol Danny Cheng got into med school
18605603559,"Jul 1, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,I think he's going to a DO school
18605603559,"Jul 1, 2016, 11:52 AM",No,I just found out I'm 162 lbs
18609676168,"Jul 1, 2016, 2:52 PM",No,

18609676168,"Jul 1, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,Like i had gotten a response from him saying he was awful at texting and then I tried to talk and then got radio silence haha
18609676168,"Jul 1, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,And what happened to that daycare?
18607168967,"Jul 1, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,Yeah what?
18609676168,"Jul 1, 2016, 3:19 PM",No,Anyways I think it's time for another foobar

18609676168,"Jul 1, 2016, 3:22 PM",No,
18609676168,"Jul 1, 2016, 3:23 PM",No,It doesn't seem too bad
18609894948,"Jul 1, 2016, 6:14 PM",Yes,lol I didnÍt even get a chance to read it yet
18609894948,"Jul 1, 2016, 6:16 PM",Yes,Oh yeah that doesnÍt look bad

18609894948,"Jul 1, 2016, 9:32 PM",Yes,I donÍt know what a binary tree is
18609676168,"Jul 3, 2016, 1:29 AM",No,Finally went to tornado room

18609894948,"Jul 3, 2016, 4:22 PM",Yes,That gives you a solid 3% chance
18609676168,"Jul 3, 2016, 4:27 PM",No,Yeah that seems a little obvious tho right?
18609894948,"Jul 3, 2016, 4:30 PM",Yes,Yeah
18609894948,"Jul 3, 2016, 4:31 PM",Yes,It might be better to be up 6-6 and up 6-0 in a tiebreak 
18609894948,"Jul 3, 2016, 4:32 PM",Yes,Then you have 6 match point 
18609676168,"Jul 3, 2016, 4:40 PM",No,Ah

18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,It's interesting to hear discussion from the other side 
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 2:01 PM",No,And Minh's head of HR so he basically just gets to make things up
18607168967,"Jul 5, 2016, 2:31 PM",No,That's really cool
18607168967,"Jul 5, 2016, 2:32 PM",No,Who does he report to?

18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 2:45 PM",No,I told him I thought he should put the guy on probation for two weeks and then Probs fire him
18607168967,"Jul 5, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,Why does Minh want to fire the guy?
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 3:07 PM",No,

18607168967,"Jul 5, 2016, 3:24 PM",No,I think you are taking word as law
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 3:28 PM",No,I mean I don't have any other sources on this
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 3:28 PM",No,And I did temper my recommendation to some sort of probationary period so he can collect more info
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 3:29 PM",No,But if that's Minh's understanding of the guy's work then that's what Minh needs to act on
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 3:30 PM",No,He did give me a sample of what the guy had spent a whole day working on as well
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 3:30 PM",No,And it was very underwhelming
18609676168,"Jul 5, 2016, 4:04 PM",No,Also he has 5 other underlings that don't suck

18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:54 PM",Yes,http://business-schools.startclass.com/
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:54 PM",Yes,This one has Penn 8
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,He said Wharton is basically a safety
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:55 PM",Yes,And then he said hyperbole
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,that implies other schools have higher preference
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:55 PM",No,That was to the Wharton is dead part
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:55 PM",Yes,Ok IÍm sure Adam will concede it isnÍt a safety
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:56 PM",Yes,Though their acceptance rate is triple StanfordÍs
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:56 PM",No,It's not an actual safety
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:56 PM",No,Except for a pretty small cadre of people
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:57 PM",No,I was deliberately making an outlandish statement
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:58 PM",No,Lol Brian every school except for Harvard is double or triple stanfords acceptance
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:58 PM",No,But I do think that what it specialized in has become a lot less desirable 
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:59 PM",No,in what way has it specialized in banking?
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:59 PM",No,most people there don't go into banking
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:59 PM",No,lol
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:59 PM",No,Not anymore
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 3:59 PM",No,Because you can't make 700k as an associate anywhere now
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:00 PM",No,And even buy side is getting a lot leaner/trending towards VC which is much closer to tech than traditional finance
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,"One of the other IS I was talking to this week was applying to H/S and then Kellogg,Anderson and considering Darden and Stern but no W"
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,lol one person
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,Why is that?
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:03 PM",No,Wanted to go into healthcare management and thought W was too focused on finance
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:04 PM",No,"And yeah one person, I already gave you the sources that were crowd based"
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:04 PM",No,You mentioned them sure
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,TBH I'm mostly just bored in an airport and wanted to stir shit
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:05 PM",No,Obv Wharton isn't actually a safety
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:05 PM",Yes,Excited for Denver?
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,But I also think we're not in the 80s anymore
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,Oh yeah I'm so pumped 
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,I don't think you can take things online like that seriously
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,There's a Cheba Hut in Denver 
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:06 PM",Yes,Bouta smoke so much weed
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:06 PM",No,I think you have to heavily discount them
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:07 PM",No,"But I think they should stop slowly shift your opinion especially when backed up by real numbers (compensation, hiring rates, retention, where classes go)"
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:07 PM",No,SAMs brother also said everyone in his class was trying to avoid banking if at all possible 
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:08 PM",No,Lol that's been happening for years
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:08 PM",No,everyone in my class went startup and consulting
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:09 PM",No,Yeah exactly
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:09 PM",No,Post 08 banking lost its luster
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:09 PM",No,but that's not news
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:09 PM",No,No but it's finally showing in the lagging metrics as well (class composition and school ranking)
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,What lol how is Wharton related to banking
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,those rankings change so often
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,I don't see how you don't correlate Wharton with finance and banking
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,And they are noisy
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:10 PM",No,But the averages are remarkably consistent
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:11 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:12 PM",Yes,I donÍt know if thats grad though
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,Thanks Brian 
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,Also you can look at cross admit data to see student preferences between schools
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:12 PM",No,And Wharton tanked post 08
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:13 PM",No,"(Again hyperbole, tanking just meaning going from 50/50 to 80/20 against H/S)"
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:15 PM",No,Yo rankings are determined by specific criteria
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:15 PM",No,that's why college rankings were so weird too
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:15 PM",No,It's the same for grad school
18605603559,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:15 PM",No,It's shit like teacher to student ratio
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:16 PM",No,If you look at 5 year rolling averages I'd say USNEWs does a good job of reflecting general sentiment 
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:16 PM",Yes,Yield at Harvard is 90%
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:16 PM",Yes,Yield at Wharton is 65%
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:17 PM",Yes,Harvard law yield is only 60%
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:17 PM",Yes,Yale is 75%
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:18 PM",No,Those yield numbers are incredible
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:18 PM",No,Wow
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:18 PM",No,HBS sends assassins if you don't accept
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:18 PM",No,It's a known fact
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:19 PM",Yes,Stanford law yield is 46%
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:20 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:22 PM",No,Pretty sure anything below a 70 is a D
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:28 PM",No,Also those numbers don't make sense
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:28 PM",No,How many b schools do you apply to?
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:28 PM",No,Shouldn't you have like really low yields ar achools 5-15 because people that got into Harvard-warton also got in all those places?
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:30 PM",Yes,You could probably run a simulation
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:30 PM",Yes,That site has acceptance rates too
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:31 PM",Yes,But i guess it depends how many schools people apply to
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:31 PM",No,I don't think people apply to that many school
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:32 PM",No,I guess I'm saying that I buy the numbers but acceptance is probably a huge crapshoot
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:32 PM",No,People that might get into Harvard-Wharton may have not applied to any T15 schools
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:32 PM",No,And then you go to the best one you get into
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:32 PM",No,Unless you have a geographic preference
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:32 PM",No,Or you just don't go to bschool after a certain cutoff 
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 4:34 PM",No,Business is not like med or law where you have to go to school 
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 7:40 PM",No,I'm really pumped for Denver
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:35 PM",Yes,What are you gonna do there
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,Some hiking some kayaking
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:37 PM",No,There's apparently some nice botanical gardens
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:39 PM",No,
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:39 PM",Yes,ThatÍs sick
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:39 PM",Yes,IÍm jealous
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:39 PM",No,Yeah a number of people on this customer just take weekends in Colorado
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:40 PM",No,Direct flight and all
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:40 PM",Yes,It looks a lot like Queenstown
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:40 PM",Yes,New Zealand 
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,That's cool
18609894948,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:42 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,Yeah that does look similar
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,Huge mountains and nearby water
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:57 PM",No,I don't have class on Friday
18607168967,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:57 PM",No,But I'm tired and cranky so I'm staying in
18609676168,"Jul 14, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,Sleep is underrated
18607168967,"Jul 15, 2016, 1:29 PM",No,Rejected by uconn
18609676168,"Jul 15, 2016, 1:35 PM",No,Oh well
18607168967,"Jul 15, 2016, 7:38 PM",No,Date tonight
18607168967,"Jul 15, 2016, 7:38 PM",No,I haven't been on one in weeks
18609676168,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:27 AM",No,How'd it go?
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:30 AM",No,I think it went well
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:30 AM",No,She's a set admitted prude so we only made out
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:30 AM",No,But we had good chemistry. We both like bad jokes and puns
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:30 AM",No,And put first kiss was in the michigan law reading room
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:31 AM",No,
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:31 AM",No,We have plans to see finding dory on Monday
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:31 AM",No,But who knows? Nothing ever works out
18609676168,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:50 AM",No,Looks super pretty 
18609894948,"Jul 16, 2016, 11:58 AM",Yes,Yeah dude thatÍs sick
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:12 PM",No,I took a look at some practice exams today
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:12 PM",No,They aren't hard
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:12 PM",No,Either I missed something or this is like a bizarre joke
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:13 PM",No,Dude Harvard is clearly the way to go. Just like do the work and you'll be top third in every class
18607168967,"Jul 16, 2016, 10:13 PM",No,Then you have a perfect gpa and your life is set
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 10:38 AM",No,Practice exams for your upcoming tests?
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 10:40 AM",No,Also I think that would just secure your first job (albeit really well) and then you'd have to be ready to crush that job just like they'd expect someone with a perfect gpa to 
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 10:44 AM",No,Also I think that many really competitive jobs are harder to keep/get promoted at than they were to obtain in the first place
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 10:45 AM",No,"E.g. It might be really hard to get a post MBA job in private equity, but of those that do then have to compete against 5 other guys who also made it for the partner track"
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,Well I don't think you fall off to unemployment
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 11:06 AM",No,I think you are well positioned even if you don't keep that dope job
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,You def don't fall off to unemployment 
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 11:14 AM",No,But you don't keep climbing up the pyramid 
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,Or at last not as quickly
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,Some of the guys in my class just get with straight baes
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,Like it's crazy 
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:09 PM",No,And some of the girls get with guys way out of their league
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,Like the social skills of law students are just so much better than science
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:10 PM",No,*science students
18609676168,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:19 PM",No,So are you a science student or a law student?
18605603559,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:24 PM",No,Lol
18607168967,"Jul 17, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,Lol hopefully I'll learn
18609676168,"Jul 18, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,vail was fucking sweet
18609894948,"Jul 18, 2016, 12:35 PM",Yes,Isn't that skiing?
18609676168,"Jul 18, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,Probably the prettiest place I've been and everything is super walkable
18609676168,"Jul 18, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,In the winter yeah
18609894948,"Jul 18, 2016, 12:39 PM",Yes,That's awesome
18609676168,"Jul 18, 2016, 12:40 PM",No,Summer is a lot of hiking/kayaking and restaurants
18609894948,"Jul 18, 2016, 1:31 PM",Yes,Sounds super fun
18609676168,"Jul 18, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,I'd be down to live in Denver post MBA 
18607168967,"Jul 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,Another decent date
18607168967,"Jul 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,She left when we were making out though

18607168967,"Jul 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,And then we were making out on my bed and I shut the light to be romantic
18607168967,"Jul 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,But it was totally dark
18607168967,"Jul 18, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,And she got up and was like I have to go
18607168967,"Jul 18, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,I have to keep my mood light on at all times
18605603559,"Jul 18, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,Pics

18607168967,"Jul 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,But I missed a few things
18607168967,"Jul 22, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,So who knows

18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 3:12 PM",No,How strongly do you guys associate the word doctor with a man and the word woman with a nurse?
18609894948,"Jul 24, 2016, 3:36 PM",Yes,I would at more so nurses and women
18609894948,"Jul 24, 2016, 3:36 PM",Yes,But it wouldn't really surprise me either way
18609894948,"Jul 24, 2016, 3:47 PM",Yes,I'm struggling with my lifts lately
18609894948,"Jul 24, 2016, 3:47 PM",Yes,155 on bench went pretty poorly
18609894948,"Jul 24, 2016, 3:48 PM",Yes,And 200 on squat is pretty hard right now
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 4:40 PM",No,I mean it doesn't surprise me when I meet a female doctor
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 4:40 PM",No,But when I think of nurses I definitely picture a woman and have to mentally remind myself then men can be nurses too
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 4:43 PM",No,Tinder doesn't work well anymore
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 4:43 PM",No,Like technically
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 4:43 PM",No,It is really slow to retrieve messages
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 9:43 PM",No,Weird
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 9:44 PM",No,Maybe it's built on top of Bitcoin
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,Bitcoin is hovering at 600
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 9:56 PM",No,Yeah but hasn't its execution crawled to molasses speed?
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 9:56 PM",No,Like transactions taking days to execute?
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 10:16 PM",No,I have no idea
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 10:27 PM",No,There was a planet money episode on it
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,I should start listening to that agin
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,Dude this looming exam is kind of terrifying
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,Because we like don't get other grades
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,And there are no answers to practice exams
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 10:29 PM",No,So you can't like train yourself
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:04 PM",No,Yeah that doesn't sound like fun 
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:05 PM",No,Do people collaborate on the practice exams to put together things they'd agree on as answers or is it too open form to really do that?
18609894948,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:05 PM",Yes,I think IÍm gonna do really poorly on these exams when I take them
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,Eh
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,Most of the kids in law school can't think logically
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:08 PM",No,So you're probably good
18609894948,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:08 PM",Yes,Also my school doesnÍt have grades
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,And even if you finish last in your class
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,You get a dope job
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:21 PM",No,Professors have to grade 80 exams
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,Each Exam is about 8 pages
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,That's 600+ pages of reading
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,The grades are definitely random
18609676168,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:46 PM",No,Do you think they use the djshivs method AKA the dartboard
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,Yes
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,But acutely
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,*actually
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,They are definitey random
18607168967,"Jul 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,No cravath for me
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:10 AM",No,How fast is the exam turnaround time? Like from when you submit to when you get grades
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:14 AM",No,Also how holistic is the essay grading?
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:37 AM",No,Super holistic
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:37 AM",No,Like they aren't essays per se
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:37 AM",No,They are weird things
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:37 AM",No,You have to look them up
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:37 AM",No,Nobody's answers are close to the same
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:37 AM",No,I think turnaround time is over a month
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:43 AM",Yes,
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:43 AM",Yes,From my dad
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:11 AM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,Lol yeah dude you'll be fine
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,First exam for me was scary
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,Then you just don't give a fuck by the end of the year
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,We had no practice exams or anything
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:12 AM",No,That's pretty cool looking 
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,And having multiple different possible correct answers will definitely be challenging given you're background
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,That long of turnaround time is evidence that they're reading the essays but yeah I'd be a bit worried
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,No Helitzer
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,You did engineering
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,I did science
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,Science is pure open ended creativity at the highest leve
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,It's just like figure out a good way to design an experiment
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:15 AM",Yes,Speak for yourself dude
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:15 AM",No,Or come up with a good line of inquiry
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,Lol
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,Lebow you did physics in undergrad
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:16 AM",Yes,I don't think I ever had an open ended question in a science class
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,Which is just engineering
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,It's not real science
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:16 AM",No,Bio in undergrad is the only real science you can do in undergrad
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,Most people don't learn what science is until the 3rd year of grad school
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,It's not just facts and equations
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,In fact it's mostly not 
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,"Also Boyu, you aren't a steering example"
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,*sterling
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,You failed your final exams
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,I think you're talking pretty specifically inquiry using the scientific method
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,No I didn't lol
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,I failed a unit of a section
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,That's true Helitzer
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,But that's what the majority of upper level bio classes are
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,How you use the scientific method to create new knowledge
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,I failed one part of organ systems and by fail it was barely fail
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,Lebow didn't take any of those classes
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,And we've talked about it before
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:20 AM",No,But that's what real science is
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:20 AM",No,Lol dude bio had you memeorize specific experiments
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:20 AM",No,memorize
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,like everything tested was taught in some way in class
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,"In my grad classes, we had to take what we learned and figure out an analogous way to determine new things"
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:21 AM",No,"Aside from the fact that that sounds kind of like a ""no true Scotsman"" experiement I still think a super open ended essay format is going to be challenging for your background"
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,No true Scotsman?
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,yeah dude analogous ways
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,we did the same thing
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:22 AM",No,it's nothing special
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",Yes,Dude also learning stuff that other people already know is stil science 
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,It is special Boyu
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,No other science classes do that
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,No
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,That's lower leve science
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,You're still limited by what you learned in class bro
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:23 AM",No,Obvi
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:24 AM",Yes,It's not lower level science
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,You can't say bio is more creative than something else lol
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,It's the difference between learning to read and learning to write
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:24 AM",Yes,People are still learning shit in grad school
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,Yes
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:24 AM",No,But I'm sure grad school physics is very different than undergrad
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,dude bio is the easiest major of the sciences
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,Lol
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",Yes,You can't design a good experiment without knowing this stuff 
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,Yes Boyu
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,I think you can definitely differentiate between creating knowledge and acquiring already created knowledge
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,That's why you get the design stuff in undergrad
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,Grad school for bio is a joke too
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,"And yes, to create knowledge, you still need to learn what was created before"
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,Of corse Brian
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,Lol dude that's what physics does too
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:26 AM",Yes,So you can't say that's not science
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,They're learning stuff like bio to apply to other things
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,Only in grad school Boyu
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:26 AM",Yes,That's not true there was plenty of room for creativity and research and designing experiments in physics
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,no that's unfair of you to compare them like that
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:26 AM",Yes,I was just not very involved in that
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,physics requires A LOT more background than bio
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,"Your background also is undergrad bio, even if you took some grad classes "
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,Yes Boyu
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,that's why you can't just start designing stuff early
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,I fulfilled a masters
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,I didn't just take some grad classes
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,dude masters is a joke
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:27 AM",No,they're all grad classes with undergrads in them
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:28 AM",No,Yes Boyu
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:28 AM",No,Yeah a masters is like a bachelors... And the upper level classes tend to be easier
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:28 AM",No,I think it's the opposite in physics
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,No to the second part
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,It's all just really hard in physics I think
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,But the creative stuff is at a higher level because you need more background
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:29 AM",No,it takes more understanding and effort to learn physics. It all builds on itself whereas bio is random ass shit
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,you can understand something in extreme detail in bio without even knowing the basics of something else but that doesn't apply in physics
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:30 AM",Yes,What did you do in undergrad bio that isn't done I physics 
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:30 AM",Yes,Because it is true that people don't design huge research projects in undergrad 
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,Not much
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:30 AM",No,A little more experimental design
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",Yes,But I'm not sure that's done in bio either
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",Yes,We did have to take lab classes with experimental design
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,But then they make ou take advanced classes where you do design projects
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,You just don't do them
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",Yes,Yeah we did that
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,Like new cutting edge stuff
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,Like you read all the papers in a field
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,And then have to come up with what's next
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:32 AM",Yes,I mean we had to do similar things
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:32 AM",Yes,In electronics lab we had to design a final project with an arduino
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:33 AM",Yes,My partner and I built our best take on a recording device out of it
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:32 AM",No,That's slightly different but along the same lines I guess
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,no that's like the same idea
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:33 AM",No,lol
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:33 AM",Yes,It didn't work that well because we had only 500 bytes of memory
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:33 AM",Yes,And then in advanced lab we probably did some more similar stuff to what you're referring to
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,That's so unnecessary to say this other discipline wasn't creative
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:34 AM",Yes,I can send you my final project on determining the excitation levels in Rb using lasers 
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:34 AM",Yes,It's pretty cool actually
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,500bytes of memory?
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:34 AM",No,What can you store in 500 bytes? 
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:35 AM",No,lol
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:35 AM",No,Data points
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:36 AM",Yes,The way we did it is we recorded 450 bytes and then took the average input from that time and stored it in a byte and repeated 50 times
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:36 AM",Yes,It didn't work for words but it sort of worked for tunes 
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:37 AM",No,Interesting
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:38 AM",Yes,My partner was a genius 
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:38 AM",Yes,He's getting his Ph.D. now
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:45 AM",No,"So Lebow the difference is that you created a thing, whereas in upper level classes you learn how to create knowledge"
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:46 AM",No,It's a fine distinction
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:47 AM",Yes,Well I think advanced lab was probably more like that
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:47 AM",Yes,Electronics is a little different
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:48 AM",No,lol wtf Lebow created something  with knowledge too...
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:51 AM",Yes,I think David means we used knowledge to build something but we didn't learn anything new from it
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,I'm still failing to see why this is all that relevant 
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 11:59 AM",Yes,I forgot the original topic haha
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 12:02 PM",No,That an exam format of long essay with multiple very different possible lines of answers is challenging to someone with David's background
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 12:04 PM",Yes,All I know is I've never done well on essay tests so I would think it will be hard at least for me
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 12:09 PM",No,You don't learn anything from the questions in bio either. You design the experiment and that's it lol
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 12:09 PM",No,Yeah I forgot the original topic
18605603559,"Jul 25, 2016, 12:09 PM",No,Ya fuck essay tests I blew at those
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 4:53 PM",Yes,Business Insider ranked Yale Law 10th
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 4:53 PM",Yes,And Penn 1
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:00 PM",No,Why is business insider publishing law school rankings
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:00 PM",Yes,No clue
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:03 PM",No,Seems legit
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,I can understand Chicgo at 1
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,It's the best school for jobs and 3rd best for clerkships
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:04 PM",No,I don't get penn
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:06 PM",No,Yale 10 tho?
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:06 PM",No,Nobody gets jobs there
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:06 PM",No,But that's because nobody wants jobs
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:06 PM",Yes,Yeah I was about to say
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:06 PM",Yes,I think itÍs more people donÍt necessarily go for the highest paying/prestige positions 
18609894948,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:07 PM",Yes,Because they have people who want to change the world and that bullshit
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:08 PM",No,Mich at 11 is probs accurate
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:08 PM",No,Harvard and chicago and yale are the best
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:08 PM",No,Stanford and columbia are equal
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:08 PM",No,Nyu is a distant 6
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:09 PM",No,Penn and Virginia are about equal after
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:09 PM",No,"Then maybe berkley, mich, and duke"
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:10 PM",No,Stanford tied with Harvard in the real rankings is bs
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 5:10 PM",No,And Chicago below h and y is bold
18609676168,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:14 PM",No,Pycharm is really pretty
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:17 PM",No,I wrote my paper but it is bad
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:17 PM",No,And it could be good if I changed like two things
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:18 PM",No,But I don't know what two things to change
18607168967,"Jul 25, 2016, 10:53 PM",No,Bloop
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:25 PM",No,People are def stressed by work and looming exams
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:32 PM",Yes,Boyu and I met another guy with a gun at a bar last night
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:33 PM",No,Where
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:35 PM",Yes,The tavern
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:35 PM",Yes,Bartender had a 9mm in his belt
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:35 PM",No,Did you leave
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:42 PM",Yes,We actually stayed for a while
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:42 PM",Yes,I mean dude was sober and all
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 3:42 PM",Yes,We just weren't gonna get him mad
18609676168,"Jul 26, 2016, 4:02 PM",No,Brian download Pycharm 
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 4:03 PM",Yes,I haven't done like 2 problem sets in a row dude
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 4:04 PM",Yes,I did have a good day of squat though 
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 4:04 PM",Yes,On my way to 225
18609676168,"Jul 26, 2016, 5:21 PM",No,That's pretty sweet for squat
18609676168,"Jul 26, 2016, 5:22 PM",No,But you should be able to catch up still
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 5:25 PM",Yes,Yeah I should
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:23 PM",No,I really don't like how families have entrenched power in America
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:23 PM",No,Bush was worse than Clinton
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:23 PM",No,Because the bushes were father and son so it's not like they were ever not related
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:23 PM",No,But this husband wife thing is also pretty bad
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,And I think it's going to happen again with Michelle
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:24 PM",No,I didn't realize america was an oligarchy 
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,The worst thing about revising is that you spend a lot of time and probably don't make your thing much better
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:30 PM",Yes,I donÍt think Michelle will run for office
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:31 PM",Yes,I think both she and Barack will get involved in more targeted work probably with black Americans 
18609676168,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:35 PM",No,I don't think Michelle will run either
18609676168,"Jul 26, 2016, 9:36 PM",No,But yeah bush/Clinton for like 75% of the last 4 decades is pretty absurd
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 10:42 PM",No,Torts is so fun
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,Was the war on drugs a way to incarcerate black people?
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,Is america evil?
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 11:48 PM",Yes,Are you serious?
18609894948,"Jul 26, 2016, 11:48 PM",Yes,ThatÍs been a criticism since forever
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,I'm sleepy
18607168967,"Jul 26, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,Are black people mostly jailed in the south?

18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,Twitter bleeds money
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,The thing is a centralized communication platform that goes out to everybody is clearly going to be important in the future
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,Like that idea is worth more than 25 billion
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:04 PM",No,And Twitter is the best one
18609676168,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:05 PM",No,What idea? Specifically
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:05 PM",No,A centralized communication platform that lets you communicate with everybody that is integrated with most things online and
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Has network effects
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,"And because of the network effects, only 1 or at most a few can be successful in that space"
18609676168,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:07 PM",No,"That idea by itself lacks nuance and revenue to be worth all that much, the successful implementation is obv a different story"
18609676168,"Jul 27, 2016, 8:13 PM",No,"Like there have to be tens of thousands of people that have had that general idea, there's no way you can make he argument that those people have contributed 250trillion+ to the world economy "
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,Like I mean the biggest implementation of the idea is Twitter
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,"And because of network effects, there is a big chance it will control the market"
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,And the market is worth a lot
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,So Twitter is worth a lot
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,Even if it hemorrhages money now  
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,Zuck is worth almost 100 bill
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,He's the richest man on the planet

18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,He owns 28% of fb
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,Fb is worth 350
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,Plus he has other money 
18607168967,"Jul 27, 2016, 9:54 PM",No,Oh that's 2012

18609676168,"Jul 28, 2016, 11:37 PM",No,"I finished reading ""the one minute manager"" and ""leadership and the one minute manager"" "
18609676168,"Jul 28, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,They were both actually really light and decently enjoyable
18609676168,"Jul 28, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,"~hour-1.5h reads, would recommend"
18609894948,"Jul 28, 2016, 11:42 PM",Yes,I'm gonna try finally reading my Harvard book on the plane 
18609676168,"Jul 29, 2016, 7:38 AM",No,Lol nice

18607168967,"Jul 29, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,China understands the invisible hand better than we do
18609676168,"Jul 29, 2016, 6:44 PM",No,Yeah but the social situation of women needing to put themselves/their families 40+ grand in the hole with fears of homelessness otherwise to get the husband's girlfriend to go away is fucked
18609676168,"Jul 29, 2016, 6:45 PM",No,I guess it's the part that women are scared of becoming homeless in the case of a divorce that seems fucked more than the fact that a service might have popped up

18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:12 PM",No,I really feel like the business logic required for decent hearth AI can't be that high
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:22 PM",No,What'd you think of my beast hunter?
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:22 PM",Yes,I thought it was just midrange with a random wrangler

18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:26 PM",Yes,Shades of undertaker hunter
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,I was also thinking of trying to make a slightly more controlling nzoth death rattle hunter 
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,2x Mufasa and 2x CotW +Nzoth is a solid late game plan IMO 
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:28 PM",Yes,Yeah but youÍll lose to ago
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,Replace snake traps with bear and/or explosive traps
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,Maybe throw in some quick shots
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,But yeah it seemed like it would be just a shade too underpowered early game
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:15 PM",No,What're your guys thoughts on nootropics (including milder stuff like caffeine)
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:19 PM",Yes,I donÍt know the term
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,They seem kind of fascinating but also scary
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:20 PM",Yes,Yeah I was just reading that
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,Like potentially really scary
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:20 PM",Yes,"I donÍt know much about that stuff, like I never took adderall and I hardly drink caffeine."
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:20 PM",Yes,It seems like itÍs not bad though
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:21 PM",Yes,Like I donÍt see anything about adverse effects?
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,Most of the stuff hasn't really undergone long term studies
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:25 PM",No,Caffeine+L theanine seems like it'd probably be okay?
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:26 PM",Yes,It seems like people are scared of it because it messes with your brain but theres not any actual harm from it thatÍs been studied at least
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:26 PM",No,There's a pretty intense subreddit on it https://m.reddit.com/r/nootropics/wiki/beginners?utm_source=mweb_redirect&compact=true
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:27 PM",No,I'm also really wondering how much riskier it is than alcohol use which definitely messes with your brain at least temporarily 
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:28 PM",No,Also what do you guys think of kombucha?
18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 1:39 PM",Yes,I donÍt know what this is but did you see this new demon?

18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 6:21 PM",No,Earlier is generally better as warm weather and sunlight are usually more fun
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 6:29 PM",No,Talk with Kevin tho

18609894948,"Aug 1, 2016, 7:47 PM",Yes,We got hammered
18605603559,"Aug 1, 2016, 8:15 PM",No,Yeah we did
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 8:15 PM",No,Sounds fun 
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,I'm worried about Epic's hiring numbers
18605603559,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,Why?
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,I don't think we hired enough this summer to keep up with turnover
18607168967,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:06 PM",No,Why do you care?
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:06 PM",No,shrinkage means that everyone does more work
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:07 PM",No,And I'm still here for the better part of a year
18607168967,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,Touch_
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,We're ~10000 people with an 18% turnover rate (from last year to this year avg across roles)
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,We hired ~1000 this summer
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,And we hired 188 last January 
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,And the rest of the months have been negligible 
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,The only way the numbers add up is if we're making a substantial switch from installing to support customers
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,Which would kind of make sense given that installing customers become support customers
18609676168,"Aug 1, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,But there's also so much m&a activity and add-ons that essentially make support customers installing ones again
18609676168,"Aug 2, 2016, 10:19 AM",No,
18609676168,"Aug 2, 2016, 10:20 AM",No,So apparently Texas is pretty antisemitic 
18605603559,"Aug 2, 2016, 10:20 AM",No,Syntha 6 edge vs syntha 6 protein
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,Sonia is so much smarter than ginsberg
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:50 AM",No,Like Sonia and roberts are by far the smartest justices on the court
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:51 AM",No,Thomas is good too
18609894948,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:52 AM",Yes,Dude Thomas is insane
18609894948,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:52 AM",Yes,Also Kennedy has all the power
18609894948,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:52 AM",Yes,So heÍs doing something right
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:53 AM",No,"When you have to read opinions for civ pro, you will agree with me"
18609894948,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:54 AM",Yes,I donÍt think IÍm ever going to consider Thomas smart
18609894948,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:54 AM",Yes,Plus he sexually assaulted some lady
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,All I'm saying is he writes clearly
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,Most of the time
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:56 AM",No,Posner is the only actual good judge in America though haha

18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,Well Adam would love posner
18607168967,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,You'll just really like him but disagree with him about a few things
18609894948,"Aug 2, 2016, 11:57 AM",Yes,I don't even know who that is
18605603559,"Aug 2, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,Remember Meghan negus
18605603559,"Aug 2, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,She got married
18605603559,"Aug 2, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,LOL

18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:03 AM",No,I need help
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:04 AM",No,Get one without fees to start
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:04 AM",No,I like my Amex blue cash
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:04 AM",No,Make sure you pay your balance every month and don't use more than 1/3 of your available credit
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:05 AM",No,That should be enough to keep you out of trouble
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:05 AM",No,how much credit would I get?
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:05 AM",Yes,You can set up bank accounts to auto pay
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:05 AM",No,Idk probabaly around $1000?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:05 AM",No,Yeah that too
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:06 AM",No,After that it becomes a game of maximizing rewards if you want to 
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:07 AM",No,word
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:07 AM",No,why donÍt I want to use more than 1/3
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:07 AM",No,?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:07 AM",No,Bad for your credit score
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,It makes it look like you're leaning too heavily on credit
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",Yes,Is that a thing?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,Yes
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,How much of a thing is up for debate
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,so if I get 500 credit
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,CanÍt use more than 165 ish?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,You can also ask them to increase your credit max
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:08 AM",No,And yeah but that's on a per month basis
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:09 AM",No,Honestly the single most important thing is timely payments
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:09 AM",No,And autopay should make that easy
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:09 AM",No,how do you set up autopay?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:10 AM",No,"You really don't want to carry a balance either, interest rates can be over 20%"
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:10 AM",No,lol holy shit
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:10 AM",Yes,You call your bank and ask them haha
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:10 AM",No,Depends on the company but usually just click through their website and attach it to a bank account 
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:11 AM",Yes,My current credit limit is 3500
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:11 AM",Yes,And IÍve def spent more then 30% a bunch
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:11 AM",No,It's not awful but it's better to not make a habit of it
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:11 AM",No,lol
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:11 AM",No,so amex blue cash?

18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:12 AM",No,I have a debit card from there
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:12 AM",No,do they just one one credit card?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:12 AM",No,Honestly which one you have doesn't matter that much to start as long as it doesn't have fees
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:12 AM",Yes,BoA Cash Rewards
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:12 AM",No,After that it's just what sort of rewards do you want
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:12 AM",No,Cash is an easy place to start
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:13 AM",No,what kinds of rewards are there?
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:13 AM",No,lol
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:13 AM",No,Often times cards partner with airlines/hotel chains
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:13 AM",No,or know of any good websites to read about this stuff
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:13 AM",Yes,BoA is just cash
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:13 AM",No,So there's things that maximize those
18609894948,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:14 AM",Yes,1% for purchases 2% for groceries 3% for gas
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:14 AM",No,I've heard the key if you're not going for cash is to make sure you get transferable points
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:15 AM",No,It's more worth looking into when you start spending more but there's definitely websites
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:15 AM",No,https://m.reddit.com/r/churning/
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:15 AM",No,Like my Implementation director for Watson has 20 credit cards
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:15 AM",No,But he also likely spends over 100k a year on them
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:16 AM",No,what do you think of blue cash preferred?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:16 AM",No,Sounds like it has a fee?
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:18 AM",No,my problem with american express is that its not as widespread
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:18 AM",No,Oh also some cards have a bunch of other built in support features like theft protection and car rental insurance
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:18 AM",No,https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-cash-back-credit-cards/#everyday

18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:18 AM",No,what do you think of the chase
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:20 AM",No,"Rotating categories isn't fantastic for your primary card and can be a bit of work to maximize, and chase also isn't accepted at a lot of places but otherwise pretty good"
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:21 AM",No,Citi Double Cash Card and the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature card
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:21 AM",No,what about those?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:23 AM",No,Didn't see the fidelity rewards on that page but citi looked good
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,debit card doesnÍt affect credit score right??
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:24 AM",No,Not to my knowledge
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:26 AM",No,http://www.cardhub.com/best-credit-cards-for-graduates/
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:27 AM",No,Skimming through those all look fine
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:27 AM",No,citi double cash looks good to me
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:28 AM",No,2% on everything is solid right?
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:28 AM",No,Just try to get~2% cash back (if you want cash rewards) and no fee
18609676168,"Aug 3, 2016, 12:28 AM",No,Yeah it's solid
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 1:18 AM",No,oh apparently you need a credit score

The FICO scoring model seems to agree with this conclusion. ñConsumers with FICO scores of 800 use, on average, 7% of their available credit,"
18605603559,"Aug 3, 2016, 11:19 AM",No,autopay says it pays 15 days after the closing date

18605603559,"Aug 5, 2016, 8:11 PM",No,the bullshit part is they changed the curriculum for this year so before I would only have to repeat that one section
18609676168,"Aug 5, 2016, 8:14 PM",No,Oh damn

18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:17 PM",No,You can write Epic server code in TypeScript (a form of JavaScript) now
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:18 PM",No,That's pretty huge for letting developers actually use a modern language 
18607168967,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:20 PM",No,How come nobody had written a parser for m before?
18607168967,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:21 PM",No,Parsers are pretty easy to write. Like it was an assignment in our intro class
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:22 PM",No,I'd guess robustness
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:22 PM",No,99.99% accurate would mean tens of thousands of bugs per year
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,Also what languages did you parse between? 
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,"And scalability/performance, M is pretty low level and it's generally a challenge to make high level languages as efficient as low level ones, e.g most AAA video games are written in C++"
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:34 PM",No,"I'm less excited after reading the wiki page on guidelines for usage, looks like they had to put in a laundry list of things we can't use to allow it to still compile to M"
18607168967,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,C++ is literally the definition of high level
18607168967,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,Lol
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:42 PM",No,What are you talking about it has manual memory manipulation
18609676168,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:42 PM",No,And it doesn't compile into another separate language (besides assembly which you'd be insane to write in)
18607168967,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:47 PM",No,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds
18607168967,"Aug 9, 2016, 10:47 PM",No,Important person

18607168967,"Aug 10, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,And each class is really really professor dependent
18607168967,"Aug 10, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,It's crazy that you guys take 4 doctrinal classes and we take 3
18607168967,"Aug 10, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,That makes no sense to me haha
18607168967,"Aug 10, 2016, 11:31 AM",No,Like am I at a baby law wchool?
18607168967,"Aug 10, 2016, 11:32 AM",No,For babies

18609676168,"Aug 10, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,We hoped that it would distract from the fact that our data was garbage

18609894948,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:25 PM",Yes,I think there is a difference but I still might go with $30 ones
18605603559,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,The better quality ones last longer
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,250
18605603559,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,I've gone through so many shittt headphones
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,I should have let you try them last week
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,"I'd say main perks are:\LFNoise cancelling \LFComfort\LFDurability\LFBetter tones, especially at extreme ends "
18609894948,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:30 PM",Yes,Well lasting longer doesn't mean I don't lose them 
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,The last point is pretty minimal to my ears tho 
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:54 PM",No,I had a pair of $300 headphones
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:54 PM",No,P5s
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:55 PM",No,Bowers and Wilkins
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:55 PM",No,They broke after 2 years
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:55 PM",No,I've had the same pair of crappy headphones for 3 years and they sound almost as good
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 12:58 PM",No,"If you want noise canceling, that's totally different"
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,I value noise cancellation pretty highly because of having my officemate
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:15 PM",No,But if you don't need it it's a pretty big expense
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:16 PM",No,I'm sleepy and don't want to study
18605603559,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,When do you have an exam?
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,Caffeine+L-Theanine
18605603559,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,Gg liver bro
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,Nah dude
18605603559,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,If you take that shit
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,I don't even caf dude
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:22 PM",No,I don't think caf is particularly bad for your liver at least compared to alcohol 
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:23 PM",No,L-theanine is Probs good for your liver
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:30 PM",No,I haven't really drank this summer
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:30 PM",No,It's definitely been a good life choice for me
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:36 PM",No,I review my notes every week or so
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:37 PM",No,"Going over them today, there have been so many connections I didn't get before"
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:37 PM",No,My torts professor in particular is a master teacher
18607168967,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:38 PM",No, But I can't talk about it with anybody because of curved grading
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,That's pretty cool
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,Boyu - do you caf?
18605603559,"Aug 11, 2016, 3:29 PM",No,Nope lol
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 4:36 PM",No,I tried soylent for the first time this morning
18609894948,"Aug 11, 2016, 4:42 PM",Yes,How is it
18609676168,"Aug 11, 2016, 4:44 PM",No,Basically tastes like the milk from a bowl of Cheerios but less lactosey (I don't think it actually has any milk in it) and very satisfying
18609676168,"Aug 13, 2016, 11:39 AM",No,You going for 225 today Bri?
18609894948,"Aug 13, 2016, 11:42 AM",Yes,Nah
18609894948,"Aug 13, 2016, 11:42 AM",Yes,I need to bench/row
18609894948,"Aug 13, 2016, 10:28 PM",Yes,Boyu is throwing a freshman dorm rager right now 
18607168967,"Aug 13, 2016, 10:30 PM",No,What's that mean?
18609894948,"Aug 13, 2016, 10:37 PM",Yes,He has like 50 people at his apartment and it's like 100 degrees in there 
18609894948,"Aug 13, 2016, 10:37 PM",Yes,Kinda fun though 
18605603559,"Aug 13, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:45 AM",No,Jill and I got into a huge fight last night
18605603559,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:45 AM",No,She broke my window and jumped out of it
18605603559,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:45 AM",No,I live on the first floor
18605603559,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:46 AM",No,she's fucking nuts
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 8:53 AM",No,Holy hell
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 10:51 AM",Yes,Shit dude
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 12:03 PM",No,Dumb
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21693419-active-life-protects-against-cancer-researchers-now-understand-why-run-day?fsrc=scn/fb/te/bl/ed/arunadaykeepsthetumouratbay
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:28 PM",No,Aside from it being done in mice and only for a couple of types of cancer
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:28 PM",No,Is it otherwise a reasonable conclusion
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:28 PM",No,Also I'm kind of blanking on where to start for this foobar
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:28 PM",No,
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:30 PM",No,My intuition is telling me it's some sort of combination of factorial and combinations/permutations of the two numbers
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:32 PM",No,Eh. That study just found what she expected to find
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:33 PM",No,And numbers with tumor size mean nothing
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:41 PM",No,Yes and why?
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:42 PM",No,Tunor siZe is silly
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:42 PM",No,It is impossible to measure
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:42 PM",No,And sometimes it's just liquid
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:42 PM",No,"When you use the new antipd1 drugs, the tumors expand at first because increased immune activity and swelling"
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:42 PM",No,But that means it's working
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:43 PM",No,Ah that makes some sense
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:43 PM",No,Also how do you measure that inside a body?
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:43 PM",No,It's super i exact
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:44 PM",No,There are all sorts of guidelines
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:44 PM",No,For measuring tumors in people
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:44 PM",No,Because doctors suck at it
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:44 PM",No,But even with the guidelines they suck
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:44 PM",No,It's a thing only cancer researchers realize
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:45 PM",No,Also there is no way adrenaline is what controls the anti tumor response
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:45 PM",No,Yeah I have no idea
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:45 PM",No,I'm sure adrenaline has been used to treat cancer in the past
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:45 PM",No,They didn't put error margins on any numbers
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:46 PM",No,It was the economist 
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:46 PM",No,Not the actual paper
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:47 PM",No,I don't have access to cell but the summary there didn't either
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:49 PM",No,Also what is the better method of measuring effectiveness then?
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:50 PM",No,Longevity
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:51 PM",No,But mostly there have to be more nuanced and end points
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:51 PM",No,It's a thing that there aren't good research endpoints for cancer studies
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,Why can't you just pick a group of mice at a certain start age and then see how many make it to avg life span
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,Or 80% of avg life span or something
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,They do that for nice
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,It's harder for people
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,That makes sense
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,But they could have done that for this study at least
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,They use genetically identical mice of the same age
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,I'm sure there is a survival graph in the study
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,It's the standard
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,And since it's not talked about
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,That means that the mice lived the same amount of time
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,(probably)
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,(Or the economist writer didn't take out the data somebody who knew cancer bio would)
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:54 PM",No,Ah
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,So you think they might have deliberately been reporting the less meaningful measure because that's the one that they saw their hypothesis validated in
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,Happens all the time in science
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,But since it's in cell
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,It is unlikely that is the case
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,That's the 3rd best journal
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,Can't fool those guys
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,Have to make up data to get into the journal
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,#2true
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,That's even grosser
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:07 PM",Yes,Oh dude I got the same foo bar
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:13 PM",No,So my first idea was to try to generate all the possible combinations of tunnels connecting nests stopping any ones where you didn't use every tunnel or connected the same nests twice
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:13 PM",No,But that seemed like it would get large and I didn't have an efficient way to do it either
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:15 PM",No,Also I wasn't really sure how I could generate the full solution space without double counting or missing any
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:17 PM",Yes,I just ran a 400 in 62 after playing tennis for an hour and in 90 degree heat
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:18 PM",Yes,I think I could break 60
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:18 PM",No,That's pretty legit
18607168967,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:18 PM",No,What's decent in high school?
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:18 PM",No,Mid-low 50s?
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:19 PM",Yes,Yeah I ran 56 but obv wasn't my race
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:19 PM",Yes,I think lifting is helping me now
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:23 PM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:23 PM",No,Good 400 runners are relatively jacked
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:23 PM",No,Not like 100runners obv but still
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:47 PM",Yes,I have no clue on foobar
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:48 PM",Yes,I shouldnÍt even be this far
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:48 PM",Yes,If I didnt cheat
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 6:58 PM",No,I had some ideas while lifting 
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:00 PM",No,"Basically figure out how many ""connections"" you need and then see how many tunnels and of what length"
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:01 PM",No,Like 4 nests is 6 connections (I think it's generally n-1! )
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:01 PM",No,And each tunnel of length n I think provides n-1! Connections as well
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:02 PM",No,And then for school tunnel you take the permutations of length p nests I think
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:02 PM",No,Haven't been back at a computer to yet any of this yet tho
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:02 PM",Yes,n-1! is the maximum number
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:02 PM",Yes,But you might have fewer tunnels
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:03 PM",Yes,Like if youÍre given 3 people and 2 tunnels
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:04 PM",No,Then you need 2 connections
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:05 PM",No,And because you need to use each tunnel each tunnel must only connect two nests
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:05 PM",Yes,What if youÍre given 3 people and 3 tunnels
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:06 PM",No,Doesn't work
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:06 PM",Yes,What if youÍre given 4 people and 5 tunnels
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:06 PM",No,You'll only be given a max of n*n-1/2 tunnels
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:06 PM",No,Then you get a bunch of permutations 
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:07 PM",Yes,Why canÍt you have 3 people 3 tunnels
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:07 PM",Yes,If you can have 4 and 6
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:07 PM",Yes,A-B-C-A
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:09 PM",No,3 tunnels is too many for 3 nests
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:09 PM",No,Each nest can only connect to each other nest once
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:10 PM",Yes,If you have 4 nests and 6 tunnels it would be a square and X right
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:10 PM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:11 PM",Yes,Why canÍt this be a thing
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:12 PM",No,I lied
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:12 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:12 PM",No,3 tunnels is fine for 3 nests 
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:12 PM",Yes,Just no more than 3
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:12 PM",No,right
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:12 PM",Yes,And at least 2
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:13 PM",No,Right
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:14 PM",Yes,And theres 3 ways to do 2 and 1 way to do 3
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:14 PM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:14 PM",Yes,I donÍt know it seems like there must be a pattern
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:15 PM",Yes,n-1! should work for the fewest tunnels
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:15 PM",No,Yeah 
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:15 PM",Yes,Except it doesnÍt work for 3
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:15 PM",No,Well n-1 should be the fewest tunnels
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:15 PM",No,Just a line basically
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:15 PM",Yes,No
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:16 PM",No,Why not?
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:17 PM",Yes,ABCD ABDC ACBD ACDB ADBC ADCB BACD BADC BCAD BCDA BDAC BDCA etc.
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:17 PM",Yes,The ones ending in A donÍt work
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:17 PM",Yes,But still
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:18 PM",No,I'm confused
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:19 PM",Yes,These are all ways to do 3 tunnels and 4 nests
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:20 PM",Yes,ABCD ABDC ACBD ACDB ADBC ADCB BACD BADC BCAD BDAC CABD CBAD 
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:20 PM",Yes,I think thats the full list
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:21 PM",Yes,12 ways
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:23 PM",Yes,My guess is theres 49 ways to do 4 tunnels 3 nests?
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:24 PM",Yes,*5 nests
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:27 PM",Yes,"My logic being that for 3 nests itÍs 1+2, for 4 itÍs 2+4+6, so for 5 it might be 3+6+12+24"
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:30 PM",No,That makes sense
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:30 PM",Yes,Could be wrong though
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:30 PM",No,"But what about all the other stuff, like 7 tunnels 5 nests and so on"

18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:31 PM",Yes,Maybe there arenÍt any of those in their test cases
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:34 PM",No,lol
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:35 PM",No,In their description there's the 4nests 6 tunnels
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:35 PM",Yes,Anyways its relatively simple to do it for n-1 nests because you can list them all out alphabetically until you find a pattern
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:35 PM",Yes,And theres going to be a maximum number of tunnels for each that will have only 1 way 
18609894948,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:35 PM",Yes,But in between I have no idea
18609676168,"Aug 14, 2016, 7:36 PM",No,Yeah I think those are the tricky ones

18609676168,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:02 PM",No,So you know how trump has like 70MM that he fundraised and isn't spending any of it on tv ads
18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:06 PM",No,Whats up with that
18609676168,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:07 PM",No,How much money would you need to buy enough guys and body armor to stage a coup? (Not that i think that would happen but still)

18609676168,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:08 PM",No,Nah you couldn't afford direct confrontation 
18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:08 PM",No,Maybe 100 billion but only if you get top U.S. generals
18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:08 PM",No,It like can't happen in America
18609676168,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:08 PM",No,But to create an armed populace that could kidnap/disrupt events at many local scale easily
18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:08 PM",No,Unless it's led by the military
18609676168,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,Like how many people and what supplies  would it take to takeover the Capitol building in Hartford 
18609676168,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,And could you do that x50
18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:09 PM",No,For 10 minutes

18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:10 PM",No,Because Obama told them not to kill them
18609676168,"Aug 17, 2016, 6:11 PM",No,So maybe not then
18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 7:03 PM",No,I'm not even sure what to study

18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 7:03 PM",No,Maybe I should take a prac test
18607168967,"Aug 17, 2016, 7:13 PM",No,This exam is going to be brutal
18609894948,"Aug 17, 2016, 7:14 PM",Yes,They did kill the Oregon dude
18609894948,"Aug 17, 2016, 7:14 PM",Yes,One of them at least

18609894948,"Aug 18, 2016, 12:28 PM",Yes,Because apparently they got bumped making them drop a handoff. But now they have to run a solo race tonight to try to hit 42.7 to qualify.
18609894948,"Aug 18, 2016, 12:29 PM",Yes,If they hit 42.7 then Canada and China will have to run a race off because they both finished with the same time 
18609676168,"Aug 18, 2016, 12:34 PM",No,Weird
18607168967,"Aug 18, 2016, 12:38 PM",No,I just fucked up that exam

18607168967,"Aug 20, 2016, 1:18 AM",No,So there is definitely still a good amount of time

18609894948,"Aug 20, 2016, 1:25 AM",Yes,But like thatÍs the thing to do as a 1L

18609676168,"Aug 20, 2016, 10:28 AM",No,I'd say there's some pretty practical benefits to having at least a couple friends at mich tho
18609676168,"Aug 20, 2016, 10:30 AM",No,"Support network for when other things suck, potential roommates, people who will ""keep you in the know"", strongest contacts for networking, lifting buddies, people you can ask favors of, goto members for group activities"

18609894948,"Aug 20, 2016, 8:15 PM",Yes,"ñDepending on which side of the fence youÍre sitting on, Asbel Kiprop is either guaranteed of a second Olympics gold medal at the Rio 2016 1,500m race, or potentially has a genuine shot at the long-standing Hicham El GuerroujÍs world record of 3.26.00, barring a cataclysmic catastrophe.î"

18607168967,"Aug 21, 2016, 6:21 PM",No,But it will take you at least two weeks to adjust
18607168967,"Aug 21, 2016, 6:22 PM",No,And it'll help to drink like 120+ oz of water per day for more energy
18609676168,"Aug 21, 2016, 7:32 PM",No,Yeah I was no caf for a while but between overall work volume and having a customer on east coast time and west coast time killed that

18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:23 PM",Yes,Plus 10% of any start up I start
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:24 PM",No,More enticing but still lol no
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:29 PM",No,That's a good offer
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:29 PM",No,You should take it
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:56 PM",Yes,How do programming languages search through documents
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:56 PM",Yes,"Like what if you wanted to find out how many times the word ""the"" showed up in the New York Times in the last year "
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:57 PM",Yes,And you had a bunch of PDFs or something
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,There's programs to convert PDFs to text
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:57 PM",No,And then I think you'd just search through the text
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:58 PM",Yes,So it's all just making text files?
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,But I don't really know how that first type of program works
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:58 PM",Yes,Is that what like Google does?
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,I don't actually know but that's my guess
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,They definitely have some image to text software
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,Used heavily for scanning older books and making them searchable
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:59 PM",Yes,But everything they do is basically convert to text files and then search
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 1:59 PM",No,They also have reverse image search
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:00 PM",No,But I think most of what they do is text file search
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,Text is relatively efficient to search over (at least compared to images) so it'd make sense to front load the processing of images to text and then allow for the searching to be quick 
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,Although they probably have fancy ways of doing the text searching itself to front load even more processing
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:02 PM",No,Maybe do contextual indexing or something
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:03 PM",Yes,I wonder how much better Google is now than like 10 years ago 
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,"Better at what? Search speed? Search ""accuracy""? Monetizing searches? All the other stuff they do besides searching?"
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:05 PM",Yes,Speed and accuracy
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,It seems like speed should be about building better indices and hardware improvements both of which seem like they should just do well with passing time
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,Less sure about accuracy
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:08 PM",Yes,I still donÍt really get how it works
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:08 PM",No,Yeah me neither
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:08 PM",Yes,ThereÍs no way they just have text files of every single site on the internet
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:09 PM",Yes,So how do they search
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,Look up Google spiders
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:09 PM",No,Or maybe they are called crawlers
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:12 PM",No,Also I don't think googles main thing is text search
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:12 PM",No,Google does indexing by back links
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:13 PM",No,Ah
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,"What about the original example if finding how many times words are used in articles, I'm still assuming that's text search?"
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:14 PM",Yes,Does google actually keep a text copy of the entire searchable web?
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,Doubt it
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:14 PM",Yes,ThatÍs basically what it seems like
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,"But you can find out by googling ""how does google work"""
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,Or we can make things up
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:14 PM",Yes,I just watched a video 
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:16 PM",No,Yeah I was planning on doing that after I had thought about it a while
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:16 PM",No,Things seem to stick better that way
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,I think thy preindex most search results too
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,They aren't conducting the search when you type it in
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,They are finding in their index of searches the search you typed in
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:18 PM",Yes,But what if itÍs not a common search
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,"Like I think that is generated algorithmically, so they have a lot of thinks"
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,But I'm sure you can still search a thing they don't have
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,Does google search open up its search APIs? You might be able to do searches and time the response
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",Yes,Well sure but it isnÍt that hard to search something no one has ever searched before
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,Then my guess is it would do a search on the fly
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,Or say 0 results
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",Yes,If you just do like a random combo of letters
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,They might also do memoization where basically every new search gets added to an index once they've done the search
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,And tell the search maker to do it and add it to the index
18607168967,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,They definitey do that helitEr
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,That was the key to solving the last foobar of there's that I did
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,Otherwise you time out on processing time
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:20 PM",Yes,Was that the find the words in as little space as possible one?
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,No
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,It was the nests and connections one
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:21 PM",Yes,You finished it?
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:21 PM",No,"Yeah, I did steal some stuff from online but I called out in comments where I had borrowed things"
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:22 PM",Yes,Nice
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:22 PM",No,Idk if it really counts or not tho
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:23 PM",No,Like I could have figured out memoization and was already thinking on similar lines but some of the stuff from graph theory was a little more arcane than I might have come up with
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:24 PM",Yes,IÍm still impressed
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:24 PM",No,I got 3/5 test cases correct w/o any help but was timing out on processing time
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:24 PM",No,You have to recognize some math shortcuts also to be able to get it
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:24 PM",Yes,I got 2/5 test cases
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:25 PM",Yes,I just hard coded the answers to their examples
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:25 PM",No,Lol.
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:25 PM",No,The last code sample I sent you was my work and got the 3/5 if you want to review
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:25 PM",Yes,Eh
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:26 PM",Yes,Seems like a lot of work
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:26 PM",Yes,Anyways I havenÍt squat in a week but my bench is improvingææ
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:26 PM",Yes,HowÍs that investor game.
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:26 PM",No,Nice
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:26 PM",Yes,?
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:26 PM",No,I haven't messed around with it since I started the nest foobar but it was good before then
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,My mom and sister were here this weekend so didn't really do much coding this weekend
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:28 PM",No,I got to the point where I was making 8k profit in the time allocated but need 10k to move to the next level
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:29 PM",No,They do tell you that the other market maker doesn't keep a history of any closed trades so there's definitely room to exploit that but I think on the actual market making I might be squeezing myself out of profit
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:31 PM",Yes,Word
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:34 PM",Yes,WashU sucks
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:34 PM",Yes,
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:34 PM",No,Like I think I need a better way of identifying which trades are mine so I don't try to make markets for my trades that are trying to make markets
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:35 PM",No,Tufts isn't even on that graph :/
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:36 PM",Yes,Get more money
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 2:36 PM",No,They are definitely trying
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 5:02 PM",No,Check out codefights
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 5:20 PM",Yes,This is pretty sweet
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:01 PM",No,I beat a couple bots
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:02 PM",Yes,I beat the first 2
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:03 PM",Yes,Then I got to the one about assigning tasks to workers and it wasn't immediately obvious so I gave up
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,It was just a couple of nested if statements
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:03 PM",No,With some trackers for what the current lowest number of tasks you've seen so far is
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:05 PM",Yes,Also the first time I played the second bot they got a perfect score with 20 seconds of elapsed time 
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:06 PM",Yes,How the fuck was I supposed to beat that
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:06 PM",Yes,They aren't supposed to get perfect scores 
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 8:17 PM",No,On all three parts?
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,How's hanging out with Jill Boyu?
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 10:38 PM",Yes,They haven't been talking
18609676168,"Aug 22, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,Just hanging out together?
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 10:42 PM",Yes,He's going after her lookalike 
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:58 PM",No,No lol
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:58 PM",Yes,But actually
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:58 PM",No,It's Brooke schumans roommate
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:58 PM",No,Lol
18609894948,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:58 PM",Yes,DoesnÍt make her not a lookalike
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:58 PM",No,She's not
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:58 PM",No,She's also okay
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:59 PM",No,
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:59 PM",No,Black bikini in the middle
18605603559,"Aug 22, 2016, 11:59 PM",No,She wants the D
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 12:06 AM",No,
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 12:06 AM",No,girl on right
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 12:06 AM",No,All potentials
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 12:06 AM",No,Idk give me some advice
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 12:14 AM",No,It's so weird I used to be a loser in high school and now I have a chance with girls that partied in high school
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 12:14 AM",No,Lol
18609676168,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:03 AM",No,Yeah I feel like those are things people tell you aren't supposed to matter but it does feel kind of great
18609676168,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:04 AM",No,And what are they like? You said you're looking for a girlfriend so I'm making the assumption that more than just looks count 
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:04 AM",No,lol they seem fun
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:05 AM",No,I don't really know either of them
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:05 AM",No,They're both well versed in Asian food
18609676168,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:05 AM",No,Lol
18609676168,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:06 AM",No,Well which one seems more likely to be able to learn to cook pho for you
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:06 AM",No,lol 
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:06 AM",No,I'm also trying this thing where I lay off the text game more now
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:06 AM",No,I think it's better especially if you've built up rapport in person
18609676168,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:07 AM",No,and are they both freshman dental students
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:07 AM",No,I feel like I only mess things up texting

18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 8:11 AM",No,You just go up to a girl and it was done lol

18609676168,"Aug 23, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,Dude caffeine+l-theanine is dope
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 11:09 AM",No,Lol

18607168967,"Aug 23, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,Wow. She's so weird
18607168967,"Aug 23, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,Is that an alpha move or just strange?
18609676168,"Aug 23, 2016, 11:26 AM",No,Mostly strange 
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 1:46 PM",No,Yo which girl did you find more attractive
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,Yo is Jill or Kate more attractive
18605603559,"Aug 23, 2016, 9:41 PM",No,Brian thinks Kate is fucking hot lol

18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 12:18 PM",No,They don't taste good lol
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 12:18 PM",No,These were pretty neutral after a couple of brews
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 12:18 PM",No,Texture was kind of weird tho
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 12:34 PM",No,

18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 3:21 PM",No,Brian I got the first one or the bug fix in our challenge but I had to add way too much code so they don't like it
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 3:30 PM",No,Nvm found a MUCH MUCH simpler way than trying to convert everything to binary and comparing using the bit wise and operator
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 3:30 PM",No,So if you find yourself going down that road don't
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 3:31 PM",No,I want to amend the constitution so Obama can be press for two more years while we find non morons to replace him

18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 3:39 PM",Yes,Did the other two though
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,The first one was really confusing
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 3:47 PM",No,It took me forever

18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:05 PM",No,Nope $10 million total
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:12 PM",No,That's a pretty solid chunk of change

18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:45 PM",No,<< is binary left shift 
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,I could be a millionaire on paper 
18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:46 PM",Yes,Meaning?
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,The company I started and then was kicked out of by a thief has raised $10 mil
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,They probably would have screwed you on equity if they didn't screw you it or the company
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,I would have had half
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:46 PM",No,Anyways inceptions just half
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,?

18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:47 PM",No,No one went back to the engineers at Xerox who made the first pc
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:48 PM",No,I'm Xerox park
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,Which became a historical footnote at best (for that contribution at least) and that's if they revolutionize the world and become multibillionaires 
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,But Xerox made a bunch other shit too and still made a butt load 
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:49 PM",No,Anyways lebow binary shift left basically shifts a number in its binary form left a number of places
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:50 PM",No,E.g 3 in binary is 11\LFShift it left one position and it becomes 110\LF
18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:50 PM",Yes,Why..
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,You're just moving the two ones one position left each
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,Should I bang this first yer
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,11 shifted left twice is 1100
18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:51 PM",Yes,What does that accomplish
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,lol
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,(Again in binary)
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:51 PM",No,Answer is almost always yes
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:52 PM",No,"So what I think it does is if you think iterate through that range it'll give you all the permutations of each element being ""on"" or ""off"""
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,"And then you use the ""bitwise and"" comparison to see if the elements from the two lists ""line up"""
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:53 PM",No,I think I could explain this much better with a whiteboard
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:57 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:57 PM",No,OMG

18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,Dude Ahhh I shouldn't
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,The other girl is worth it
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,but horny
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 9:58 PM",No,OP
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:00 PM",No,Lol honestly you need to focus on that test
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:00 PM",No,"So do whatever's going to be relatively quick, not involve too much drinking and what screw up whatever you want long term with these girls"
18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:07 PM",Yes,ThereÍs a cute jewish girl on my floor
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:07 PM",No,Dibs

18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",No,How do you like it so far?
18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,All we had today was a barbecue 
18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,So I havenÍt met that many people 
18609894948,"Aug 24, 2016, 10:09 PM",Yes,Seems good though

18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,Then my friends left the bar and we couldn't meet up with them
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,And she just decided to leave
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,Hahahah
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,we were sitting on my couch and she just peaced LOL
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,Maybe she actually did want to just pre game and then go out
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:11 PM",No,well I barely know her
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,so that's just weird
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:12 PM",No,And she didn't know any of the people that were out

18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:14 PM",No,especially if you guys just met
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,What's your explanation?
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,Idk gaha
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,Hahaha
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,Boyu did you invite her over to pregame and she didn't realize it was just you two
18607168967,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,She thought there would be people there
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,nope she knew
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:37 PM",No,
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:39 PM",No,That doesn't actually support your claim
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:40 PM",No,
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:40 PM",No,lol what do you mean dude

18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:41 PM",No,"I mean that's very possible, just those shots don't really show it"
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:41 PM",No,lol dude it was her and me meeting up with my friend
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,Classmates
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:46 PM",No,Unless I'm dumb trust me I have been getting the vibes from her
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:46 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:46 PM",No,but dude this girl got out of a long term relationship recently according to fb
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:47 PM",No,i finally figured out a strategy tho
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:47 PM",No,Just invite a girl out with me Togo with my friends
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,Makes sense
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,Bringing girls to social gatherings establishes you as a social central piece which is generally desirable 
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,Exiting Long term relationships is tricky
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,ya

18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,That's a while
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,There's an above average chance she's unlikely to really know what she's looking for for a while 
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,yeah you're right dude
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:52 PM",No,she was pretty forward with me the first night we met

18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:53 PM",No,But eh dude I'm more attractive than her objectively
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,Glad you figured out a way to objectively measure your own attractiveness
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,both my roommate and his gf said that lol they keep giving me shit for the girls
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,the girl that I sent the message to tho is legit really attractive and it's an interesting situation
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,There's a small chance she didn't know it was me
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:55 PM",No,Interesting interesting
18609676168,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:55 PM",No,Well I should go sleep

18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:55 PM",No,so she snapchatted her number to me the night before after a bar crawl before going to the bar
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:55 PM",No,near our place
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:55 PM",No,and I never said it was me when I texted her
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:55 PM",No,That night or the morning after
18605603559,"Aug 24, 2016, 11:56 PM",No,but I also feel like she would have asked who is this but who knows...
18609894948,"Aug 25, 2016, 1:47 PM",Yes,Boyu you know Blake Ellison?
18607168967,"Aug 26, 2016, 7:22 PM",No,Crim law is focusing on homicide and rape
18607168967,"Aug 26, 2016, 7:22 PM",No,Great...
18609676168,"Aug 26, 2016, 7:46 PM",No,That's pretty lurid

18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 10:01 AM",No,Wow. I'm not sure if I agree with that
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 10:32 AM",No,You want to be able to plan
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 10:33 AM",No,And to be able to plan you need information
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 10:41 AM",No,Think of it this way: you aren't your performance but you are the manager of your own performance
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,Yeah but denying reality when it comes to whether a girl is into you or not leads to sexual assault
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,Oh Jesus
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:02 AM",No,We had a big miscommunication

18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:03 AM",No,Yeah that was my bad
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,Also isn't Tarski all about not denying reality
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,That you should want to believe whatever is true
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:04 AM",No,So if they're not into you you should want to believe they're not into you and all
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,Is that it? I googled it because I wasn't familiar
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,I may have misread it
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 11:05 AM",No,It was in HPMOR a bit when Harry is trying to teach Draco about genetics and what that means for blood purity

18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:05 PM",No,It's kind of a series of short biographies of the peeps that invented important tech stuff from the difference engine through Google 
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:08 PM",No,And that's pretty cool
18609894948,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:09 PM",Yes,Learn anything?
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:09 PM",No,We (being the US military at the time) gave all the original software jobs to women because we thought that hardware was the hard part lol
18609894948,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:10 PM",Yes,It does have hard in its nam

18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:14 PM",No,"Gates stole a bit too, mostly from Xerox, but even on things he wasn't stealing he was just really aggressive in negotiating for himself"
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:14 PM",No,Like him and a group of other teenagers had this little coding gig in high school where in order to pay for their using computer time they paid the local hospital for access to terminals
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:15 PM",No,And so they did ad hoc work for various companies to make money to pay for that
18609894948,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:15 PM",Yes,why is that aggressive 
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:15 PM",No,Haven't gotten there yet
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:15 PM",No,At one point the group didn't work with him on something but after they invited him back
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:16 PM",No,And he only came back on the condition that he'd be the sole decision maker for the group for forever after that
18609894948,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:19 PM",Yes,DoesnÍt seem like he was in a position of power
18609894948,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:19 PM",Yes,Unless they really wanted him back
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:22 PM",No,Gates was a great negotiator
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:22 PM",No,And a creep
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:22 PM",No,He designed a computer system for choosing classes for his hs
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:22 PM",No,He put himself in classes with the hot girls
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:22 PM",No,Also gates bought dos for 60 k
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,And stole gui from Xerox
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,His great deal was an exclusivity contract for operating systems with ohm
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,*ibm
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,They started doing business with some company that needed a tax SME basically
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:23 PM",No,Gates is almost entirely a businessman
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,And gates for some reason knew enough about business taxes in his teens or faked it till he made it
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,No dude
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,They give you specs
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,And you build to those specs
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,I meant for getting back in the business as a teenager
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:24 PM",No,That's what his group was missing
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:26 PM",No,Also not getting locked into an exclusivity contact himself so he could license software to other hardware
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:31 PM",No,The early stuff with Charles Babbage and using sewing textile punchcards was cool too
18609676168,"Sep 6, 2016, 5:36 PM",No,Ada Lovelace postulated a lot in the mid 19th century that was later vindicated about how computers would be generalizable and use subroutines and compute symbols other than just math
18607168967,"Sep 6, 2016, 9:38 PM",No,I'm a fool
18605603559,"Sep 7, 2016, 7:13 AM",No,Would you say if a girl doesn't respond to a text she's not interested?

18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:34 PM",No,What does that question mean?
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:34 PM",Yes,The classes at the start of the semester
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:34 PM",Yes,What should I be focusing on
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:34 PM",No,Nothing yet 
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:35 PM",No,You're one week in. The framework of the course emerges

18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:35 PM",Yes,"Yeah, itÍs just weird having no real work all semester"
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:36 PM",No,Yeah it's pretty strange
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:36 PM",No,Especially because you don't have grades
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:36 PM",No,"So like for you, it's just do the reading"
18605603559,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:36 PM",No,Lol

18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:36 PM",No,And then study for finals
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:36 PM",Yes,Super weird
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:36 PM",Yes,What Boyu?
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:37 PM",No,How much work do you have per class? Like 15-20 pages of a casebook per class?

18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:37 PM",Yes,But property is like 30 pages/class
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:38 PM",No,Wow. That's a significant amount of reading with 4 classes
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:38 PM",No,Do they meet 3 times per week?
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:38 PM",Yes,No twice
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:38 PM",No,Oh that's not terrible then
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:38 PM",Yes,Property is a lot because our professor is a pure academic and wrote the book
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:38 PM",Yes,But itÍs more straightforward than other stuff
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:38 PM",No,Is he the chicago guy?
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:39 PM",Yes,No

18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:44 PM",No,No. We have weird kids but not like crazy autistic brilliant kids that I imagine Harvard and yale have
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:45 PM",Yes,I donÍt know if thatÍs how IÍd characterize the kids I think are weird
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:45 PM",Yes,OneÍs just too loud and a couple others just arenÍt super social
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:45 PM",Yes,But for the most part theyÍre pretty normal
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:47 PM",No,Do you have a prac test in any classes?

18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:47 PM",No,We did and I know my dad did when he started
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:47 PM",Yes,Was it helpful
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:47 PM",No,Who knows

18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,But getting top 30% probably won't be a cake walk
18607168967,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:48 PM",No,But it also won't be that hard
18609894948,"Sep 7, 2016, 4:48 PM",Yes,No one will know

18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:36 PM",Yes,I had 3 classes to read for today
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:36 PM",Yes,So it was hard to
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Double property?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",Yes,We have 6 days where we donÍt have class and 6 where we have double class
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",Yes,For make ups
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Though I don't think I've ever had over 60 pages
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",Yes,For 2 classes technically
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,That's so weird
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",No,Do you get jewish holidays off?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:37 PM",Yes,No
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:38 PM",Yes,But you can if youÍre religious

18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:38 PM",Yes,But the first 3 weeks all have double property
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:38 PM",Yes,IÍm just gonna read case briefs
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:38 PM",Yes,Not the cases
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:40 PM",No,Word. Not the worst idea
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,"All you get is convoluted, poorly formed opinions that may or may not be correct with the actual case"
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,And you get the distillation of the the important parts with the brief
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:41 PM",No,@helitzer one page of cases takes like 3 minutes to read
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:41 PM",Yes,And hope I donÍt get cold called
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,Who cares if you get cold called and mess up?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",Yes,Eh itÍs the very start
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,Well I guess I don't care what mich people think about me
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",Yes,DonÍt want to look like a scrub too early
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",No,But Harvard is dif
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",Yes,Dude wtf
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",Yes,We also have a closed memo outline due Sunday at 5
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",Yes,That he just told us about
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:42 PM",Yes,And I have to read 7 cases before I can do that
18609676168,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,That's a good chunk of reading then 
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Closed memos aren't that bad
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Do you have writing again before it's due?
18609676168,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:43 PM",No,Sounds like law school is a lot of work
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:44 PM",Yes,Yeah
18609676168,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,You should have just gone with the two year party school/networking event option
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:44 PM",Yes,Draft due a week from Tuesday and final in October
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:44 PM",Yes,Just doing all this reading/outlining will be a pain
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,"He doesn't have grades, so it's not bad"
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,No no no you misunderstand
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:44 PM",No,My prof told us what to take from each case for the closed memo
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,So we all wrote the same thing basically
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,We did the reading then discussed it in class
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:45 PM",Yes,Ugh
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:45 PM",No,And he told us what to take
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:45 PM",Yes,That would be nice but right now IÍm not even worried about writing well and shit
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 8:45 PM",Yes,Just getting this reading done
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 9:07 PM",Yes,This is the first year ever that Harvard is majority female
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:05 PM",Yes,He gave us 9 cases and they all just lead to 1 sentence rules
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:05 PM",Yes,So I'm assuming it's enough to know that
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:05 PM",Yes,And never go into property law
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:08 PM",No,That's all of law
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,Btw con law is so weird. Who knew all the crazy shit that happened in the us
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:23 PM",Yes,Karan spoke at lunch today
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,"In law, they give you absurd cases and they all are just 1 sentence rules that are intuitive. It's unclear how much of the reading you actually have to do"
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:23 PM",Yes,Kagan*
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,What's she talk about?

18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:24 PM",No,Haha what?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:24 PM",Yes,Also she has to open the door when the justices are discussing cases and anyone knocks
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:24 PM",Yes,And she has to take all the notes at their meetings
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:25 PM",No,Hahahaha I'm dying
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:25 PM",Yes,SheÍs been there 6 years too

18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:26 PM",Yes,She also does a reading group here for older students
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:26 PM",No,Also do you really work with them?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:26 PM",Yes,How baller would that be
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:26 PM",No,So baller

18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:27 PM",Yes,Not for grade or anything 
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:27 PM",No,Yeah I don't know if we have those

18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:31 PM",Yes,How cool would it be if someone from your section became president
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,We'd be fucked. A mich law grad?
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,But people in your class will be senators
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,At least
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:31 PM",Yes,Gerald Ford bro
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:31 PM",Yes,MichiganÍs pride
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:32 PM",Yes,I donÍt think anyone in my section is elected office material
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:32 PM",No,Then it's you
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:32 PM",Yes,Lol
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:32 PM",Yes,One of the other sections IÍm sure

18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,That's true and superfluous
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:33 PM",Yes,He played football there
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:34 PM",No,Yes but he wasn't mich law

18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:52 PM",Yes,ThatÍs split in half
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:53 PM",No,Do you know them all?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:54 PM",Yes,I could probably do everyone by name at this point
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:54 PM",Yes,But havenÍt talked with all of them
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:54 PM",No,How many princeton and Harvard?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:54 PM",Yes,"Not many princeton, only 1 that I know of"

18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:54 PM",No,How many brown?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:55 PM",Yes,No idea
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:57 PM",Yes,Actually we have 1 kid who might be gunning for elected office
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:58 PM",No,Most kids take time off?
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:58 PM",Yes,65% maybe
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:58 PM",Yes,All my friends are the ones who went to state schools
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 10:59 PM",No,They will still have graduated from Harvard law
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:00 PM",No,And they definitely had 4.0s ar state schools
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:00 PM",Yes,I donÍt know that they did
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:00 PM",Yes,ItÍs not all state schools
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:00 PM",Yes,But like lesser known schools
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:00 PM",No,It's only 20% Ivy
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:01 PM",No,Probs another 20% Ivy equiv
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:01 PM",No,"(Stanford, Hopkins, washu, northwestern, chicago, etc...)"
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:01 PM",No,And then 60% random
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:01 PM",Yes,Maybe
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:01 PM",No,Nah this are just facts
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:01 PM",No,*those

18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:05 PM",Yes,85
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,Zero here
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:06 PM",No,Probs in the whole law school
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:07 PM",No,I think 1 kid speaks fluent English here though
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:08 PM",Yes,There are 7 gay guys in my section
18609894948,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:08 PM",Yes,That I know of
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,This school is only 10% guy
18607168967,"Sep 8, 2016, 11:09 PM",No,There is a lesbian misandrist though
18609676168,"Sep 9, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160907/NEWS/160909919
18609676168,"Sep 9, 2016, 11:13 AM",No,Epic is trying to take a case to the Supreme Court
18609676168,"Sep 9, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,Also can someone tell me what this company actually does
18609676168,"Sep 9, 2016, 11:25 AM",No,http://www.thapaworldwide.com
18609894948,"Sep 9, 2016, 5:49 PM",Yes,Some kind of delivery system?
18607168967,"Sep 9, 2016, 6:07 PM",No,Had sex with that jswipe girl 
18607168967,"Sep 9, 2016, 6:07 PM",No,She says we have to be exclusive sex partners though
18607168967,"Sep 9, 2016, 6:39 PM",No,Am I in a relationship?
18609894948,"Sep 9, 2016, 6:39 PM",Yes,Do you want to be
18607168967,"Sep 9, 2016, 6:39 PM",No,No
18609894948,"Sep 9, 2016, 6:43 PM",Yes,Then don't
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:30 PM",Yes,Why do we give patents for developing new drugs
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:31 PM",Yes,Why donÍt we just have a system where the government pays pharmaceuticals enough to cover all the ridiculous research costs and then we sell them for their manufacture price
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:37 PM",No,I agree
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:38 PM",No,And that (or a dif system) will probably be my life's work
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:38 PM",Yes,Yeah?
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:38 PM",No,That system you proposed doesn't differentiate winners from losers
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:38 PM",No,"So there would be lots of ""embezzlement"" by pharm companies"
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:39 PM",Yes,Eh I guess but it seems easy enough to modify it
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 12:39 PM",No,"But yeah, I talk about how the proper incentives and relationships between academia, gov, and pharma aren't there all the time"
18609676168,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:21 PM",No,There's a model I read about that I think is used in Europe for prosthetics where different companies essentially bid for the government contracts and so the bids should theoretically keep things competitive but then the government ultimately ends up owning it
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:22 PM",No,Yeah because europe is so good at science
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:22 PM",No,Most innovative drugs come from there
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:22 PM",No,Like literally none ever
18609676168,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:23 PM",No,There prosthetics are better or at least parity and about 10x cheaper
18609676168,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:23 PM",No,Idk what their pharma setup is
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:27 PM",Yes,DidnÍt go to the game David?
18607168967,"Sep 10, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,I went for the first half
18609676168,"Sep 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Are you guys watching the pen st Pitt game
18609676168,"Sep 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",No,Just got a first down on 4th and 16 down by 3
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",Yes,HavenÍt been 
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 3:42 PM",Yes,Just ran into Sam though
18609676168,"Sep 10, 2016, 3:43 PM",No,Yeah she said she just ran into you
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 3:44 PM",Yes,Penn St just threw a pick?
18609676168,"Sep 10, 2016, 3:45 PM",No,Yeah that just happened right after they made a huge 4th down play
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:23 PM",Yes,You guys have to watch the end of CMU v OK St
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:23 PM",Yes,Craziness
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:23 PM",Yes,Really interesting situation too
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:24 PM",Yes,The play before was 4th down for OK St. They ran the game clock out and threw the ball away. Got called for intentional grounding. The refs gave CMU an untimed down where they ran that play
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:25 PM",Yes,The interesting part is that by rule there shouldnÍt be an untimed down given if a penalty is on offensive team and there is a loss of down
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:25 PM",Yes,So the game shouldÍve been over
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:26 PM",Yes,The point of that rule existing is so that you donÍt get a redo if you do an illegal forward pass on a last second lateral play
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:26 PM",Yes,But it shouldÍve applied here too
18609894948,"Sep 10, 2016, 4:26 PM",Yes,

18607168967,"Sep 11, 2016, 11:35 PM",No,We're going to have a trump presidency
18607168967,"Sep 11, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,"If she knew she was sick, she is the most selfish, evil person in post 1950s history"
18609676168,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:07 PM",No,"And I guess FDR was the mos selfish, evil person in pre 1950s history?"
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:24 PM",No,No one individual can be blamed for hitler with a knowledge of how bad and evil he would be who had a recent prototype for his evil and who was aware enough via perspective about how bad hitler would be
18609676168,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,I was actually making a more direct comparison to another presidential hopeful running for office despite knowledge of poor health
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,Nobody was going to beat fdr
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,"Here, Hilary might very well lose because of her previously undisclosed health condition"
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,And it opens the door for an evil man to assume lots of power
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,Holy shit
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,This is gonna be fucking nuts
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,If trump wins

18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 9:47 PM",Yes,ThereÍs a court a minute from my dorm
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,IÍm going crazy
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,studying
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,lol
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:19 PM",Yes,"did you have to do all this puposivism, intentionalism, textualism bullshit david?"
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,Yeah in writing/practice
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,We don't have a huge amount of it though
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,And a little in crim
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",Yes,WeÍve been doing it in leg reg 
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",Yes,Seems pretty dumb
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",Yes,IÍm pretty sure textualism is just correct
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,Oh leg reg isn't require here
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,Ok Scalia
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,Most fed judges would disagree
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",Yes,But actually
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,Mostly because there are lots of statutes that are written really poorly
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,And aren't consistent with other statutes in the same jurisdiction
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",Yes,So write them better
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,yooooo
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,But they are already written
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,How's the girl situation
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,need something to distract me as I study
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:25 PM",Yes,Like you can use absurdity or whatever in really crazy cases like Kirby but mainly trying to judge congressional intent seems so dumb
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,"But if everything was written well, then textualism is obviously the way to go"
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,Also judges are really greedy power hungry assholes who like having control
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,So the ability to interpret things the way they want to makes them happy
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,Posner writes about that sometimes
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,Posner is the man
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:26 PM",Yes,Yeah 
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:26 PM",Yes,ScaliaÍs a good writer
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:27 PM",No,Yup
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:27 PM",No,The good writers have been conservatives recently
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:27 PM",No,Sonya is a good writer (but she's new)
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:27 PM",Yes,Probably because they use textualism and that actually makes sense
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:27 PM",No,Before that Brennan was the last good liberal writer on the court
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:28 PM",No,Eh. You'll read cases where scalias textualism proves too much
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:28 PM",No,And it leads to obviously unjust results
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:28 PM",No,The goal of the justice system is justice
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:28 PM",No,Not just following the letter of the law
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:28 PM",Yes,Unless a case is super ridiculous I doubt it
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:28 PM",No,lol
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:28 PM",Yes,And thats what absurdity is for
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,lolol
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",Yes,WhatÍs up Boyu
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,how the fuck did you two become lawyers hahah
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,No it doesn't read to absurd results like absurdity in all cases where it doesn't lead to good results
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,You guys were always science esque
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,Sometimes the results are just the opposite of what the conscious of society wants
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",Yes,In that case go by the statute
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,it's just weird to hear you talking about law
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",Yes,Congress can change it
18605603559,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:29 PM",No,Lmaoooooo
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",Yes,And try to suck less
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",No,So you would promote injustice because you are a stickler for the letter of the law
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",Yes,Congress is promoting injustice
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",Yes,IÍm enforcing laws
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",Yes,Besides I never said anything about enforcing injustice
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",No,Judges aren't there to enforce laws
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",Yes,Interpreting
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:30 PM",No,That is what the executive branch does
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:31 PM",No,Well I hope they never let you be a judge
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:31 PM",Yes,IÍm like actually convinced this is the right answer
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:31 PM",No,You'd let bad things happen to prove to congress (who isn't listening to your decisions) know they wrote shitty laws
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:31 PM",No,When you have the power to do good things
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:31 PM",Yes,I never said anything about allowing bad things happen
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:32 PM",Yes,These arenÍt good v bad cases
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:32 PM",Yes,TheyÍre courts trying to take power cases
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:32 PM",Yes,In a case like Kirby v US I wouldnÍt let it happen
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:32 PM",Yes,Anything much less absurd IÍd probably let happen
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:32 PM",No,I also think courts should have very limited power
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:33 PM",No,And that liberal judges often overstep the intended power of the court
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:34 PM",Yes,But like the cases weÍre reading about this are def not good v bad
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:34 PM",No,"But I'm just saying, you'll run into numerous bad statutes in 1l when enforcing them as they are written leads to results you would say are unjust "
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:34 PM",No,And so interpretingn them wih legislative intent leads to more seemingly just results
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:35 PM",Yes,Give me 1 example
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:35 PM",No,Honestly I don't have particularly good one
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,Gasperini is the closest to one I have off the top of my head
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:36 PM",Yes,I donÍt think itÍs as common as youÍre saying
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,Like 2-3 cases so far 
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,I'm sure it's not that common
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:36 PM",No,Especially in practice
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:37 PM",Yes,And in the cases it does apply to it might be better for deciding that case but what about future stuff
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:37 PM",No,You just used it twice in a row and I think you are referring to dif things
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:38 PM",Yes,Used what twice in a row
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:38 PM",Yes,Oh
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:38 PM",Yes,Yeah
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:38 PM",Yes,I was talking about cases where textualism is unjust
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:38 PM",Yes,In both 
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:39 PM",Yes,In cases where textualism is unjust it might be better to use legislative intent for that case
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:39 PM",Yes,But maybe that makes a rule that doesnÍt work in the future
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:39 PM",Yes,The point is it isnÍt a hard question and Scalia was right
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:40 PM",No,Oh yeah completely
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:40 PM",No,It usually makes sense to just follow the statute
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:40 PM",No,Unless realt serious injustice results
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:41 PM",No,And then only use the interpretation there
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:41 PM",Yes,Which is absurdity doctrine
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:41 PM",No,"Like I said, I haven't taken leg reg"
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:41 PM",Yes,Easily my best class
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:41 PM",Yes,Because Jodi Freeman is an all star
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,Regarding non-statutes; (common-law rules) - sometimes they are too specific 
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,And need to be stated at an appropriate level of abstraction to make sense when applied
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,That's a thing in torts
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:42 PM",Yes,Torts is dumb
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:42 PM",No,But that isn't statutory interpretation
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:43 PM",No,Torts is really dumb
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:43 PM",No,Fuck torts
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:43 PM",Yes,Civ pro is dumber
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:43 PM",No,Is it?
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:43 PM",No,Why do you say that?
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:43 PM",Yes,I donÍt give a shit about diversity jurisdiction
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:43 PM",Yes,Like at all
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,Eh. Civ pro will probably make you a better practicing lawyer
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,Than not taking it
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:45 PM",Yes,I want to be Jody Freeman
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:45 PM",No,Like do you really care about any of the classes you are taking?
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:46 PM",No,"The only relevant ones to your future are civ pro (if you do litigation), contracts (but not really, actually contracts are much dif), and leg reg"
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:46 PM",Yes,Do most of your professors have JDs or SJDs
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:46 PM",No,Jds 
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:47 PM",No,Haha I don't go to a good school dude
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:47 PM",Yes,Only 1 of mine has an SJD
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:48 PM",Yes,But 2 have PhDs
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,Is it a foreigner?
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:48 PM",Yes,From Canada
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,That makes sense
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:48 PM",No,Llms (and I guess by proxy sjds) are for foreigners
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:48 PM",Yes,Yeah
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:49 PM",Yes,ThereÍs 1 American getting an LLM this year
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,Sjd admission site says you need an lm
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:49 PM",Yes,Everyone elseÍs foreign
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:49 PM",Yes,Yeah she did that too
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,I am not taking any classes with PhDs
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:49 PM",No,But a fair number of proffessors have them
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",Yes,2 of mine went to Yale too
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",Yes,Fuckers
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",No,I have 2 yales and a chicago
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",Yes,YouÍre supposed to go to Harvard to teach at Harvard
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",No,(And then writing is mich; not a real professor)
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",No,No bri
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",Yes,At least weÍll beat Yale in football
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",No,All schools are inferior to yale
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:50 PM",No,Yale is where professors go
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,Everybody in your class
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,Got rejected from yale
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,Everybody
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,There is no financial aid to compete with 
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",Yes,I dunno dude
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",Yes,This seems pretty convincing to me
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:51 PM",No,Because neither offers merit based aid (maybe a few poor people got better aid)
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:52 PM",No,But at least 500+ kids got rejected
18609894948,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:52 PM",Yes,nah yale is just weird kids
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:52 PM",No,"What I said isn't totally true, I met a yale undergrad at admitted students weekends that decided on Harvard law "
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:52 PM",No,Because she is from Palo Alto and went to yale undergrad
18607168967,"Sep 12, 2016, 11:53 PM",No,Also the yale kids are definitely really weird
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 12:25 AM",Yes,My leg reg book is written by like the only conservative harvard prof
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 12:25 AM",Yes,So maybe it picks and chooses
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 12:25 AM",Yes,But ScaliaÍs reasoning is way better than his opponents
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 1:02 PM",No,Is there anywhere that publishes cross admit survey data? For business schools that's somewhat accessible information
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 1:03 PM",No,And isn't Scalia a dick tho?
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 1:03 PM",No,
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 1:03 PM",No,Also look at the Google reviews for my customer
18607168967,"Sep 13, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,Posner is so fucking good
18607168967,"Sep 13, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,He's so good
18605603559,"Sep 13, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,I'm like legit freaking out rn
18605603559,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:11 PM",No,Like I'm sitting here and I can barely focus
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:12 PM",Yes,Scalia tends to be conservative. But at least on opinions that aren't very political he's incredibly consistent at reading statutes literally 
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:13 PM",Yes,I don't really know what cross admit survey data is
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:13 PM",Yes,Boyu when's the test
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:14 PM",No, Like of students who got into both where'd they go
18605603559,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,Friday
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:15 PM",Yes,Oh yeah David and I kinda guessed at one point based off admission data
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:15 PM",Yes,But we donÍt really know for sure
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:16 PM",Yes,You got this dude
18605603559,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:16 PM",No,It's making me freak out about everything else too
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:16 PM",Yes,ItÍll be over in a week
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:17 PM",Yes,IÍd say focus on that for the next couple days and then you can get everything else straightened out
18605603559,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:17 PM",No,It's this Friday
18605603559,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:17 PM",No,
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:17 PM",Yes,Yeah and then its done 
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:18 PM",No,Forget about the big overwhelming picture for the moment and figure out what the next physical step you should take is
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:18 PM",No,"Do you need to study more for this test? If so when's the next time you're planning on studying, do you have that written down somewhere that you'll check? "
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 3:19 PM",No,"If it's now, what's the next thing you can do, is your book open, etc. Break it into chunks, the individual tasks often will feel far more manageable if you make them actionable"
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 4:20 PM",Yes,Going to the sox game tonight
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 7:19 PM",No,Nice

18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 7:20 PM",Yes,Orioles 
18607168967,"Sep 13, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,That should be dope
18607168967,"Sep 13, 2016, 7:45 PM",No,How many kids are going?
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 7:45 PM",Yes,They're already down 5-0
18609894948,"Sep 13, 2016, 7:46 PM",Yes,In the second inning
18607168967,"Sep 13, 2016, 8:59 PM",No,I'm like 90% sure that I'm in a relationship 
18609676168,"Sep 13, 2016, 9:16 PM",No,That's going to need a little explaining
18605603559,"Sep 14, 2016, 1:15 PM",No,Dude Saara Carissimi to go out in Norwalk
18605603559,"Sep 14, 2016, 1:15 PM",No,This weekend over snap

18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 2:04 PM",Yes,And yeah Matthew was telling us that uber was stealing people from Google for self driving cars
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,It's so cool
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 2:04 PM",No,Hello future

18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 6:54 PM",Yes,"This restaurant I'm at has the slogan ""don't feel awful, get a falafel"""
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 6:57 PM",No,Sage advice
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:00 PM",No,Just had my 2 year review
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:05 PM",Yes,How was it
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:06 PM",No,"It went well, we have to write a self review beforehand"
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:07 PM",No,And I had been deliberately pushing the boundaries on how much positive spin I could add
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:07 PM",No,And my TL went along with that so I'm happy
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:08 PM",Yes,Lol in what way
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:10 PM",No,"Like they ask you how you're performing in your job broken down into quality, quantity, and complexity"
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:10 PM",No,And you write blurbs for each as well
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:10 PM",No,And my TL ended up writing down the same ratings as I put for myself
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:11 PM",Yes,Nice!
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:29 PM",No,Nice dude
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 7:33 PM",No,Thanks!
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,Grades come back friday (people think)
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 8:50 PM",No,What if it turns out I am bad at law achool? (Real possibility)
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 8:50 PM",Yes,YouÍll be fine
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 8:50 PM",Yes,No point in stressing now
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 8:51 PM",Yes,IÍve already accepted my grades will probably be bad haha
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 9:03 PM",No,Yeah but you don't have to worry about that
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 9:03 PM",No,You are in a position where you can not do well and do great
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,We are not in the same position
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 9:04 PM",Yes,Not if IÍm trying to get a clerkship
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,That's true
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 9:32 PM",No,"I think you'll both end up doing well, hopefully while it still counts"
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 9:33 PM",Yes,You also only have to do well 1st semester because then professors look t your old grades when they grade you
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:12 PM",No,I don't think they see your old grades here
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:13 PM",Yes,I mean they say everythings blind here
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:13 PM",Yes,But people seem to have their doubts
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:13 PM",Yes,The best kid in each class gets DeanÍs Scholar
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:14 PM",Yes,And itÍs in the schoolÍs best interest that a small number of kids get the majority of the DSÍs
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:14 PM",Yes,Because then they look good for important positions
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:22 PM",No,Yeah I but that
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:22 PM",No,Hopefully I get the a+ and then it's over
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,We aren't all blind
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,First round of grading blind
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,Then they get your name and adjust
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,You never see the first grade
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:23 PM",Yes,why
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,It's total bullshit
18607168967,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:23 PM",No,I'm not sure
18609676168,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,Profs Probs talk to each other even if they're not directly sharing grades they're Probs sharing impressions
18609894948,"Sep 14, 2016, 10:33 PM",Yes,Theoretically here all professors see is your exam with a number on top

18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:10 PM",No,ya so ryan has all As
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,except for one A+ and one A-
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,and apparently the dean of the school loves him and has been talking him up to a lot of judges
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:11 PM",No,heÍs interested in supreme court lol
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:12 PM",No,He must have been pretty much top of his class at NYU
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:12 PM",No,he signed at cravath on friday
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:12 PM",No,heÍs only a 2L
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:13 PM",No,I don't know if that's unusual for when people sign at Cravath 
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:13 PM",No,I think itÍs normal
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:13 PM",No,and the class he got an A+ in was the class the dean of the school taught
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:13 PM",No,so heÍs made a really good impression
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:14 PM",No,I think he was already full ride NYU or a lot of money from there
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:14 PM",Yes,Everyone gets offers for 2L summer and then 99% of them get an offer for the next year
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:16 PM",No,Sounds like he's executing real well
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:16 PM",No,How's he like NYU?
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,Wow. He's fuxking killing it
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,Those grades are pretty absurd
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,He's probably number 3-5 in his class
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:17 PM",No,why 3-5? lol
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,Two people get straight As?
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,A+ is 4.3
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,And most professors give at least 1 per class
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:18 PM",No,he has a 4.0
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,So ryan has a 4.0
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,But some people have higher than that
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,I bet some people donÍt give A+s tho
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,"At least at Mich, a couple people have above a 4.0 by the end of 2 semesters"
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,not all professors get them and not all of them are going to top students
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:19 PM",No,Correct Boyu
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,But he's probably not the only person with a 4.0 or above
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,There just aren't many 
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,Like at all
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,"He's probably not #1, but he's damn close"
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,not that it matters tho
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,a 4.0 at NYU gets you anywhere
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,lol
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:20 PM",No,I mean if you were talking about SCOTUS it might matter for that
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:21 PM",No,Not too many spots there
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:23 PM",No,But yeah he got Cravath so he has that whole world wide open to him if he wants it
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:24 PM",No,do you guys think its worth waiting for the 7 plus
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:24 PM",No,or just getting the 7
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,What do you currently have?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,6
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,and I broke it last night
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,so I could either use a 5S for a little bit
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:27 PM",No,and wait for the 7 plus
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:28 PM",No,the only difference between the two is literally the extra 12MP camera on the plus
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:28 PM",No,I'd go 7 then
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:29 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:29 PM",No,whats your reasoning?
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:30 PM",No,It's cheaper and I don't think I'd need another camera. I also don't like huge phones so that's just a personal preference thing
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:32 PM",No,Is the 7 as big as the 6?
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:32 PM",No,The 6 is too big for me
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,I think so?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,yeah
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,same size
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,I was really thinking plus
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,lol
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:34 PM",No,What's your reasoning?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:34 PM",No,I donÍt mind size. the camera just seems sick
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:34 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:34 PM",No,is that a stupid reason?
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:35 PM",No,Whats the price difference?
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:35 PM",No,@helitzer and Lebow
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:35 PM",No,Do you guys snapchat?
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:35 PM",No,Yeah sometimes 
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:36 PM",No,This supplement reading is going slowly. Also fuck torts
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:37 PM",No,And I guess I've never had a problem with the iPhone cameras and the 6 is supposed to be better than the 5 and the 7 better than that but the 6 vs 5 comparison was effectively unnoticeable for me so I don't think I'd get much out of upgrading two tiers above that
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:38 PM",No,hmmmmm
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:40 PM",No,Like what screen are you going to use where you could even view a 12MP photo on without zooming out?
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:41 PM",No,Like at 144 pixels per inch (apples retina quality) you'd need a 27inch by 20inch monitor to get all of the pixels on screen
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:42 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:42 PM",No,TRUE
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:43 PM",No,There definitely might be other things that affect photo quality that also got better but idk I'd rather buy some nice food or clothes or something with the extra money if you're looking to spend money
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:46 PM",No,oh p plus has an extra gig or ram
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,Oh
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,That's something I'd actually value 
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:51 PM",No,Should increase how much time till its obsolete hopefully
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:55 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,true true
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,I'd Probs still go for th 7 but mostly because I don't want a gigantic phone
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,I think you're going to Probs want the 7plus
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:57 PM",No,Although I also think you'll Probs break or lose it before either becomes truly obsolete 
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:57 PM",No,wow the new camera is amazing
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:57 PM",No,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1p2xtrgV7_t2boJ_8j4mmAJ-FabgaUBR866HC6lxe4/edit

18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:57 PM",No,the low light shots
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,Yeah you'll break it in a month
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,dude
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 2:59 PM",No,should I drive to stamford to get a phone
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,I wouldn't
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:00 PM",No,or holyoke ma
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,Can't you just order it online?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,dude its backordered for 3 weeks
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,I was on reddit and there are people picking up store reserves
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,You'll appreciate it even more if you anticipate it for a bit
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,I donÍt have a phone
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:01 PM",No,dude
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,I broke my iPhone 6 last night in NYC
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,IÍm using iMessage on mac
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:02 PM",No,I guess if you actually don't have a backup it might be worth the time
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,think the iPhone upgrade program is worth it
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,?
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,No 
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:04 PM",No,I think you basically just want to buy one outright and then use it until it's a borderline antique 
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:04 PM",No,lol
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:04 PM",No,I think I'm going to switch to droid with next phone
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:04 PM",No,I was also thinking about that
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:04 PM",No,Not sure yet
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:05 PM",No,The seven definitely seems underwhelming 
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:05 PM",No,And I don't have an apple computer locking me into the ecosystem either
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:08 PM",No,I am hoping to not get another phone for 2-3 years tho so hopefully something actually awesome will be out by then
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,2-3 years?
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,You expect an apple phone to last more than 2 years?
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:15 PM",No,Planned obsolescence dude
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:16 PM",No,I had my last one for 3.5
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 3:49 PM",No,Any idea how painful it is to develop iPhone apps on a Windows computer without dual booting into iOS first?
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 5:02 PM",No,You can't
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 5:02 PM",No,I'm pretty sure
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:18 PM",No,I grabbed an iPhone 7 plus
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:18 PM",No,It's sick
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:19 PM",No,and no one else can get one for weeks
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,When did they come out?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,16tg
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,16th
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,Nice dude
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,Where did you go to get it?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,It's backordered. I used a Reddit thing and located inventory
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,And then I'm apart of the iPhone upgrade plan
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:35 PM",No,Where did you get it?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:36 PM",No,Holyoke ma
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:36 PM",No,I really don't think the iPhone upgrade plan is a good deal but otherwise nice work 
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:37 PM",No,I got the256
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:37 PM",No,and free apple care
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:37 PM",No,I also upgrade all the time
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:37 PM",Yes,"""Free"""
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:37 PM",No,Yeah just bundled
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:38 PM",No,Although if they'll take care of all the ways you break your phone it might be worth it 
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:39 PM",No,Yeah Boyu needs Apple care
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:41 PM",No,So you're paying 549/yr for a minimum of 2 yrs?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,The iPhone 7 plus costs 520
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,I'm paying 550 for it to use one year lol
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,With apple care
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:42 PM",No,I mostly want to upgrade every year
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:43 PM",No,Also there's no such thing as 2 year upgrade deals anymore
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:43 PM",No,so any iPhone you buy is 700
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:43 PM",No,Either you pay up front or every month
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:43 PM",No,Right so I'd look at it from a yearly cost perspective 
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:43 PM",No,And 550 seems pretty steep
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:44 PM",No,Although if you do really want to upgrade each year that is what it's designed for
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:45 PM",No,The iPhone 7 plus 256 is like 1000 dollars
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:45 PM",No,Dude
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:45 PM",No,if you buy it
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:46 PM",No,Yeah 969
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:47 PM",No,And I'd really hope to get more than 2 years out of something I basically spent a grand on
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:48 PM",No,It's a break even point of 21 months
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 6:48 PM",No,"So after that you basically have a ""free"" phone"
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:47 PM",No,I mean it is a dif of $60/year to get a new phone every year
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:48 PM",No,And you get insurance
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:48 PM",No,It's definitely worth it for somebody like Boyu
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:48 PM",No,And not for somebody like Helitzer
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:48 PM",Yes,I have a 4S
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:49 PM",No,I think that Apple did well with price discrimination to find the market of Boyus that like new things but also cater to helitErs that like saving money and don't care about new things
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:49 PM",No,Lebow that is because of your birthday curse
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:49 PM",No,You should wear contacts on your birthday and use an old phone that week
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:50 PM",No,Yeah that's a pretty apt analysis
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:51 PM",No,Anyways just went for a 15 mile bike ride
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:51 PM",No,It felt good
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:52 PM",Yes,It was one birthday haha
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:52 PM",Yes,I should just not get blackout 
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:52 PM",Yes,ThatÍs pretty legit Adam
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,Thanks
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:52 PM",No,Deadlifted this morning too
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:52 PM",Yes,I havenÍt gone to the gym in a week
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:52 PM",Yes,QBÍd the flag football team to victory this morning though
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 7:53 PM",No,That's pretty legit
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 8:49 PM",No,"So it's looks like I'd have a couple of options to try to develop on iOS without buying a Mac \LF1. Build a ""hackintosh"" and dual boot into Apple\LF2. Use some sort of VM to simulate an apple environment\LF3. Do the development on Windows and then compile using a jail broken iPhone \LF4. There's some software suites that specialize in this but they look either expensive or limited"
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 8:56 PM",No,Yeah you have to dual boot
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 8:56 PM",No,I don't think 3 is legit
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 8:57 PM",No,It would only work on jail broken phones
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:00 PM",No,The person on stack overflow is claiming you can still submit it to the App Store but I have no idea
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:04 PM",No,"K I googled this a year and a half ago, so I would trust him, not me"
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:20 PM",No,This seems like it'd be annoying to setup 
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:21 PM",Yes,why not write an android app
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:21 PM",No,Because I couldn't use it
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:21 PM",Yes,TRUE
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,Yeah it's bullshit
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:27 PM",No,Fuck Apple for being in a closed loop
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,You'd think one nerd would have made one thing to download and hen you can just make a thing for Apple
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,But nope
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:28 PM",No,There's a software thing called appcelerator that's supposed to just let you write in JavaScript and deploy cross platform but the reviews are mixed
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Oh that's dope
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,There's another similar thing but in C# called Xamarin but the free version is super limited and the cheapest paying tier is 300/year 
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Apple is bullshit
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:29 PM",No,Yeah I think I'm going to try Appcelerator mostly because I've been meaning to learn JavaScript at some point anyways
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,All languages are basically the same
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,(Well there are like 3 classes of languages)
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,iPhone 7 plus is sick
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,Legit so sick

18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,Lol
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:30 PM",No,Go for it dude
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:31 PM",No,Do it
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:31 PM",No,And @david yeah basically languages within a group just differ in what sort of parenthesis you use and where and what the same shit is called
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:33 PM",No,
18609894948,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:33 PM",Yes,missed the porno part
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,The light adjustment seems really good
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 9:36 PM",No,Is that your room?

18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,Wow. That's cutting it close
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,What did you need?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,60
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:04 PM",No,Hahah
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,How did you fail a test where you needed a 60 twice?
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,believe me that test wasn't fair
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,it was super random
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,The average was a 66
18607168967,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:05 PM",No,How many people failed?
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,Congrats Boyu! And yeah how many people failed
18609676168,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,Seems like an avg of 66 with any variance should be a good number
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:28 PM",No,I really have no idea
18605603559,"Sep 18, 2016, 10:42 PM",No,Brian

18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 7:59 PM",No,I didn't feel like doing work so I watched season 4 of inside amy schumer
18609676168,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:14 PM",No,How was it?
18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:14 PM",No,Eh ok

18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,I liked them
18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,It is a sketch comedy show
18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,So it's hit and miss
18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:23 PM",No,And it's amy schumer
18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:24 PM",No,So it's kind of clever gross out humor 
18609676168,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:25 PM",No,Makes sense
18609676168,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:25 PM",No,I've generally liked what I've seen of her
18607168967,"Sep 19, 2016, 8:27 PM",No,She's my girl
18609894948,"Sep 20, 2016, 9:16 PM",Yes,I hear Judy dressed up as the mad hatter today

18609894948,"Sep 20, 2016, 11:59 PM",Yes,"I have learned one thing though - when you write applications for things, youÍre way more likely to get if you write a personal story rather than just reasons why you want to do it"
18609676168,"Sep 21, 2016, 10:00 AM",No,Did you have to apply for student practice orgs?
18609676168,"Sep 21, 2016, 10:00 AM",No,"But yeah that makes sense, anyone could have those reasons but your story is why YOU want to do it"
18609894948,"Sep 21, 2016, 10:15 AM",Yes,I had to apply to one

18605603559,"Sep 22, 2016, 9:34 PM",No,lol legitimately
18609894948,"Sep 22, 2016, 9:34 PM",Yes,She's cute 
18609676168,"Sep 22, 2016, 10:15 PM",No,Yeah go for her
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 9:05 AM",No,I think I'm going to be glad to leave epic when I'm planning on doing so
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 9:05 AM",No,I've heard more and more talk of faster installs with fewer customer analysts and we're hiring fewer people
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 9:05 AM",No,That doesn't add up well for expected workload
18607168967,"Sep 23, 2016, 10:24 AM",No,How cash positive is epic?
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 10:52 AM",No,I don't know
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 10:54 AM",No,I'd guess pretty cash positive as about half of our staff are billing their hours to customers and bill rates are usually about 4x salary and salary costs are 80-90% of our costs 
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 10:57 AM",No,"And IS are probs billing close to 40hrs per week, but idk what the billability % is for other roles"
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 10:59 AM",No,"Another way to look at it would be that we have a revenue of around 2B and if we were profit neutral and staff were 80% of costs then the average salary would be 160,000 but it's clearly much lower than that"
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 11:17 AM",No,The rumors ive heard are that we want to make installs cheaper so that we can start sweeping up all the smaller customers as those are kind of the only ones left in the US
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 11:18 AM",No,Anyways looks like I'm getting a new officemate
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:01 PM",No,Would you girl on left
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:15 PM",No,Why do you ask?
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:15 PM",No,All potentials
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:15 PM",No,on the list
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:16 PM",No,Can you expound on that a bit?
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:16 PM",No,Girls I can smash
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:16 PM",No,I have to be selective tho
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:16 PM",No,you can only smash like 1 or 2
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:16 PM",No,I already messed up with one
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:16 PM",No,like I just didn't smash her when she wanted to
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:18 PM",No,Ah that kind of makes sense 
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:18 PM",No,Are you trying to date?
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:19 PM",No,dude I just want something on the side atm
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:19 PM",No,dating if I like the girl lol
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:19 PM",No,What happened to Victoria?
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",No,Exactly idk what happened with that. That's the one that wanted to smash
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",No,I didn't text her for a week and then I texted her on Wednesday and crickets
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",No,dude so I don't know what's up
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",No,Lol why didn't you text her for a week
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",No,She was giving me great vibes
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",Yes,lol
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:20 PM",No,She probably just felt like an option after that
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:21 PM",No,SHe went to Boston last eeekend
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:21 PM",No,Weekend
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:21 PM",No,so there was really nothing to text about
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:21 PM",Yes,shouldÍve come dude
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:21 PM",No,So you didn't text her for a full week after you had been clicking?
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:22 PM",No,lol we've been talking for like a while now
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:22 PM",No,@david is that the play? I've been out of it for about
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:22 PM",No,A bit
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:22 PM",No,I also was extremely drunk two weekends ago and didn't make a move. She made herself very available
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,like she came over to take shots after a party before the bar
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,and then she was always around me at the bar and we danced
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,but that's two weeks ago
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,lol
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",Yes,maybe you shouldnÍt have ignored her for a week
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,I've been trying to not text much these days
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,dude I don't think I did
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:23 PM",No,Lol she can always text me
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:24 PM",No,idk I see her this weekend
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:25 PM",No,I think your pendulum swung a bit far on that one
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:25 PM",No,ugh
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:25 PM",No,you think I should have been texting her?
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:25 PM",No,I don't want to be needy
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:25 PM",No,There's definitely a line to walk
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,Btw I asked her to froyo two weeks ago and she Rainchecked me
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,But I think that lines more frequent than once a week
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:26 PM",No,I think she did have work
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,Well
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,I tried a different method and it might have backfired
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,But I feel like texting is bad
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,It's a tool
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,It can be overused 
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:27 PM",No,I'm bad at texting
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,It's the weakest part of my game
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,Git gud
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,Lol
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:28 PM",No,At the very least try to line things up for in person time over text 
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,That was my goal
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,I just had no way to do it
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,I'd still shoot for this weekend
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,I was busy
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,Good you should be busy 
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:29 PM",No,But honestly you can text while you're taking a shit and you're never too busy to shit
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,I'd say to take some initiative and offer concrete plans for an activity this weekend
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:30 PM",No,I'll pick you up at X to go see Y 
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:32 PM",No,"If you're really nervous put it before a prior commitment so she knows when it's going to end, one of people's biggest hesitancies is about spending more time on something than they want to"
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:32 PM",No,I'm totally fine with in person dude
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:32 PM",No,I'm more nervous texting and anticipating the reply
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:33 PM",No,lol it's like the opposite 
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:33 PM",No,But also she didn't reply
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:33 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:33 PM",No,:(
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:34 PM",No,"I'd take getting ignored for a week as a slight, you have to do some rekindling after that "
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:35 PM",No,Do you think that's what she felt like?
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:35 PM",No,Yes
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,Way too much focused interest reeks of desperation but none at all just implies that you don't see them as a priority 
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,I'd rather have the 2nd one
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,Lol
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,Too little interest than desperate
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,False dichotomy
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:36 PM",No,There's middle ground
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:39 PM",No,I will say some of this is contingent on actually wanting to date them
18607168967,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,"Also she might just think you are creepy and didn't get the hint when she ""rainchecked"" you"
18607168967,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:42 PM",No,#shotsfired
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,quite possible
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,but she was also trying to smash me the night before
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:43 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,and puked up my bathroom
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,I asked her to get froyo the next morning and then at night she rainchecked
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:44 PM",No,Because she was apparently too hungover all day and didn't start studying
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:45 PM",No,Meh I don't think I played this one right
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:45 PM",No,I know that for sure
18607168967,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:53 PM",No,Why did you ask a girl out the day after she threw up at your place
18607168967,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:53 PM",No,That's so weird
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:53 PM",No,Lmaoooo I wasn't thinking
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:54 PM",No,Yeah I thought your move was to try to smash while they were still puking
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 12:55 PM",No,"At least that's what Ryan Sila, pride of NYC law, told me"
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:18 PM",Yes,My neck is in a lot of pain  whenever I turn my head
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:18 PM",Yes,Bad sign?
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:19 PM",No,No
18605603559,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:20 PM",No,Might be how you slept
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,I had that happen to me once in middle school 
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,Could barely get it to looking straight ahead
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:21 PM",No,Staid home a day and next day it was fine
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:21 PM",Yes,That makes me feel better 
18609676168,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,Obviously an anecdote with sample size one
18607168967,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,Yeah it's definitely just sleeping poorly
18607168967,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:22 PM",No,Also did you gym yesterday?
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:22 PM",Yes,Should I try to sleep in a specific way 
18609894948,"Sep 23, 2016, 1:22 PM",Yes,No

18609894948,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:04 PM",Yes,Much more interesting though - King v Burwell
18609894948,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:06 PM",Yes,Obamacare was passed through a unusual process called reconciliation which doesn't involve the normal congressional process because they didn't have the votes to do it normally
18609894948,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:06 PM",Yes,And it didn't have the normal oversight 
18609894948,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:08 PM",Yes,And the law allows the gov to create federal exchanges but every other time in the law it references exchanges it says created by the state
18609894948,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:09 PM",Yes,So basically they fucked up writing it and read literally federal exchanges could have no participants 
18609894948,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:09 PM",Yes,And the Supreme Court bailed them out
18609894948,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:09 PM",Yes,And Scalia goes off on them for doing so in his dissent
18609676168,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:27 PM",No,Huh
18609676168,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:27 PM",No,That's interesting

18607168967,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,About the individual mandate (everybody has to buy health insurance) and whether the fed gov can shove expanded Medicaid down the states throats
18607168967,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,She mentioned in class about the reconciliation. She said it led to errors but didn't say what they were
18607168967,"Sep 30, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,She being professor
18609676168,"Oct 1, 2016, 10:20 AM",No,"Hmm apparently we aren't live yet, I think we were supposed to go live at around 2 AM"

18609676168,"Oct 1, 2016, 12:56 PM",No,Interface engine crashed catastrophically during cutover and were talking about going live without interfaces at this point
18609894948,"Oct 1, 2016, 12:59 PM",Yes,Is that your stuff?
18609676168,"Oct 1, 2016, 1:00 PM",No,"Epic interfaces are, interface engine is third party/customer owned but generally speaking - yes"
18609894948,"Oct 1, 2016, 1:00 PM",Yes,Ah word - hope that doesnÍt make your next couple days too stressful 
18609676168,"Oct 1, 2016, 8:05 PM",No,Thanks!
18607168967,"Oct 1, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Did you guys see the mich game?
18609894948,"Oct 1, 2016, 8:11 PM",Yes,Yeah

18609894948,"Oct 1, 2016, 8:54 PM",Yes,It wasnÍt that great a game
18609894948,"Oct 1, 2016, 8:55 PM",Yes,Best play resulted in Michigan losing 35 yards
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:46 PM",No,Vba syntax sucks donkey dick
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:49 PM",No,And the autocomplete and highlighting in the IDE is awful
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:52 PM",No,"The amount of time I spent debugging because it was supposed to be ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks.Add instead of Active.Sheet.Hyperlinks.Add is super frustrating, especially because the debugger wasn't erroring until 3 lines later"
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:52 PM",Yes,Sounds pretty annoying
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:53 PM",No,Are you guys going to services?
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:54 PM",Yes,IÍm not
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:54 PM",No,You might be the stupidest person I've ever met

18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:54 PM",No,Do you realize you are single
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:54 PM",No,And jewish Harvard girls are going and you go to Harvard law????
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:54 PM",Yes,Lol IÍm not trying to pick up girls at Rosh Hashanah services
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,Are you Fuckig kidding me???
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,What the fuck is wrong with you?
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",Yes,Lol dude
18605603559,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,Yeah Brian you're dumb
18605603559,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,Lmao
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,"First of all, you personally do not pick up girls, you meet and befriend them"
18605603559,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,I wish I had that resource
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,Which is totally acceptable at services
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:55 PM",No,"Second, what the actual fuck is wrong with you?"
18605603559,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,it's a good place to meet girls from all sorts of schools
18605603559,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,Within Harvard too
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",Yes,I think IÍll be alright 
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,This is literally the best opprotunity to meet jewish women that exists
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,Services?
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,You are such a fucking idiot
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,You mostly just sit there
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,I'm losing my shut
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",Yes,Yeah I donÍt know what kind of services you go to
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",Yes,If I want to meet jewish girls I should go to a Hillel event
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:56 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,Only weird Hillel girls go to those
18607168967,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,All the jew go tonight
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",Yes,Meh
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",Yes,IÍm getting dinner with a friend
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,How the hell do you become anything more than unfamiliar acquaintances at services
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",Yes,So whatever
18605603559,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,which friend Brian?
18609676168,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,You literally are just sitting there for hours
18609894948,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",Yes,"Jenny, my friend who went to undergrad with me"
18605603559,"Oct 2, 2016, 5:57 PM",No,oh lol
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:25 PM",No,I'm leaning towards going for oral surgery again
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:26 PM",No,And I'm on a study mode grind again
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:26 PM",No,The gears are turning
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:38 PM",No,What happened to pediatrics?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:42 PM",No,idk I really want to do more surgical procedures than cavity preps
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:42 PM",No,For what it's worth I think if you can do it well the barriers to oral surgery seem higher than the barriers to pediatrics 
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:42 PM",No,No lol
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,it's the opposite
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,Explain 
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,Peds is the hardest specialty to get into
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,Why?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,low number of spots extremely high pat
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,pay
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,That could just be a temporary market imbalance
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:43 PM",No,Naw
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,Is there any fundamental barrier to more peds places opening?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,oral surgery is relatively easy to get into from UConn
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,(Presumably offering care at a lower price)
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,Kids generally crush the CBSE exam because we are on a med curriculum
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,Scoring in the top 1-5 percent of all applicants
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:44 PM",No,On average
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,Okay but what's stopping more pediatric dentists from entering the market and depressing the average pay?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,The national organizations limit residency spots
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,What's stopping additional clinics from opening
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,Oh
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,that's how derm works too 
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,There's a limited amount of spots bro
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,That's the answer I was looking for
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,Same for most competitive residencies
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:46 PM",No,That's why they're so competitive and pay a lot
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:45 PM",No,there's no residencyspots?
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:46 PM",No,"I knew that was true for medicine, didn't know it held true for dentistry "
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:46 PM",No,How often does that organization update its limits?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,they don't update it
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,A school wants to open spots and they apply to accredit its program
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,which can be rejected
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,Wait who actually has residency spots 
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,I thought residency was after school 
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,"Schools, hospitals"
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,Anywhere with clinics can have residencies
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,and can apply for new residencies
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,So can residencies get added by clinics?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,But the national body keeps track of stuff
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,Only if the national organization says yes
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,And does that increase the total number of residencies?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,They have to apply
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,Right 
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,but peds is super limited
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,But the total number of residencies can change?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:50 PM",No,And is the new ortho of dentistry
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,my friend's cousin makes 400k in ortho and apparently his wife makes more than him in peds and they're relatively newly grads within 3 years
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:56 PM",No,Right but what's the durable barrier? Is the national agency just not going to noticeably increase spots? If not why not and how would you know that?\LF\LF It doesn't seem like the actual work for peds would take considerably more skill than something like oral surgery so why the higher standard?
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,*Long* term profit premiums are *rare* so I'm curious as to why you think they would exist here
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:08 PM",Yes,My weeks are starting to get pretty nuts 
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:08 PM",No,Yeah?
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:09 PM",Yes,Yeah it's good but I'm struggling to keep up reading
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:29 PM",No,Word. 4 doctrinals is a lot
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:30 PM",No,At least your grades don't matter haha
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:31 PM",Yes,Yeah 4 plus writing
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:31 PM",Yes,Low pass is pretty bad
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:31 PM",Yes,I gotta avoid that
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:33 PM",No,You probably want that high pass for at least one class to get a good relationship going with a prof too
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:33 PM",No,I'm about to enter the hardest part of the biomedical sciences curriculum
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:33 PM",Yes,Yeah. I think I'm gonna do best in civ pro which has a visiting prof unfortunately 
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:34 PM",No,Nah he can't have a good relationship with a prof at Harvard
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:34 PM",No,It's not a thing
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:34 PM",No,Haha
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:34 PM",No,Lebow you'd have to fuck up badly on the exam to get a low pass though
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:34 PM",Yes,Actually my section leader is super dedicated to helping us
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:35 PM",Yes,I think because he wants to tell everyone e gets people jobs
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:35 PM",No,Is that writing?
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 5:35 PM",No,Don't you get someone to write you reccs for stuff tho?
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 7:04 PM",Yes,No thatÍs torts
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 7:05 PM",Yes,Yeah but I think he would write one if I get a pas or higher
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 7:36 PM",No,Fuck torts dude
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 7:47 PM",Yes,Yeah man
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 7:51 PM",No,But how else are you going to talk with burtness about Tort reform?

18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 10:58 PM",Yes,Sounds awful
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 10:58 PM",No,Is this the place that you anticipated would have a bad install 2 months ago?
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:04 PM",No,Yeah

18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:15 PM",Yes,What did you say
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:15 PM",No,What did she say?
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:17 PM",No,I didn't respond
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:17 PM",No,Just remembered about it just now
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:17 PM",No,Here you go
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,Btw I just want to be left alone
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:22 PM",No,that's my 100% consensus
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:23 PM",Yes,I mean it seems like it depends how much you consider her a close friend
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,I don't consider anything
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:23 PM",No,But someone I want to stay far away from
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:24 PM",Yes,Well she clearly thinks of you as a close friend because you donÍt say that stuff to someone thatÍs not
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,btw I haven't spoken to her in 2 months
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,Neither has she made the effort
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:24 PM",Yes,I would try to communicate with her at least once and say (in a nice but clear way) that you donÍt want to talk with her
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:24 PM",No,Except once to say she'll fucking ruin my life
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,over snapchat and then in person the next day
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,Not talking to her is the best way to say you don't want to talk to her
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:25 PM",Yes,I think thatÍs mean to someone youÍve had significant contact with in the past
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:25 PM",No,It's definitely cold
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,But Jill hasn't done Boyu many favors 
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:26 PM",Yes,I think if you clearly say you donÍt want to talk and then donÍt respond itÍs nicer
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,I think it drastically increases the chances of getting drawn in
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:26 PM",Yes,Plus this is someone heÍs still going to see at school
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,That is true
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:26 PM",Yes,He canÍt just avoid her forever
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:26 PM",No,Eh maybe you're right then
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:31 PM",Yes,  Should I ask this boring girl on a date
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:31 PM",No,If I send her any response she is going to respond 
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:32 PM",Yes,Yeah for sure but then you can ignore
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:32 PM",No,Responding is too dramatic
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:32 PM",No,Yo keep in mind she blocked me on text and facebook
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:32 PM",Yes,"You can send 1 text saying ""thanks, I think it's for the best that we don't talk right now"""
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:32 PM",No,For the last 2 months
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:32 PM",No,Brian's idea is to say we are done
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:33 PM",Yes,And then nothing else
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:33 PM",No,and I get this random text from nowhere
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:33 PM",No,When not saying anything says the same thing
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:33 PM",No,After I kicked her out of my house
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:33 PM",No,I don't feel like I owe her a response
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:33 PM",No,If you don't want to respond definitely don't 
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:34 PM",No,I think responding has a lot more potential downside 
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:37 PM",Yes,I spent all summer hanging out with you 2 together
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:37 PM",Yes,Like you guys were best friends as of a few months ago
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:37 PM",Yes,Seems cold to not say a thing
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,dude she blocked me on text for 2 months
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,She had a chance to say this 2 months ago
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,lmao
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",Yes,Not saying sheÍs in the right either
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,It's definitely cold
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,But it protects yourself
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,Cold doesn't mean wrong
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,I just want her to stay away from me
18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,Forever
18607168967,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:38 PM",No,Sometimes cold is the right thing
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:39 PM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:39 PM",Yes,I stand by it being the wrong move
18609894948,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:39 PM",Yes,But do you

18605603559,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:43 PM",No,I need to avoid someone so mentally lethal
18609676168,"Oct 3, 2016, 11:54 PM",No,Yeah I'd just stay away

18609676168,"Oct 7, 2016, 3:03 PM",No,But mostly just so potential employers don't think you're deliberately hiding something really bad

18607168967,"Oct 7, 2016, 8:06 PM",No,Hillel is terrible

18609676168,"Oct 7, 2016, 10:30 PM",No,So you know how Clinton is worth something like 50M officially?
18609676168,"Oct 7, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,Is that all just speaking fees?
18605603559,"Oct 7, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,lol
18605603559,"Oct 7, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,Lolololilolol
18609676168,"Oct 7, 2016, 10:32 PM",No,Are you laughing about Clinton or GFs?
18605603559,"Oct 7, 2016, 10:32 PM",No,Both
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:19 PM",Yes,Do you guys ever listen to the fivethirtyeight podcast?
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,Not yet
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:41 PM",No,Been meaning to start
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:42 PM",Yes,IÍm listening to the one recorded yesterday right after the Trump comments
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:42 PM",Yes,ItÍs pretty interesting
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:47 PM",No,What did they say about it?
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:48 PM",Yes,They said itÍs shocking that nobody uncovered this kind of stuff in the republican primaries
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:48 PM",Yes,And that it feels like April and not October
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:48 PM",No,Probs Hilary was sitting on it the whole time
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:48 PM",Yes,Yeah but that doesnÍt explain 16 other candidates not finding it
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",Yes,Plus that implies some kind of coordination between the Washington Post and Clinton 
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",Yes,Which may or may not be true
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,Or trump didn't want to be pres and he leaked it himself
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,Lol
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,And washpo is definitely linked to Hilary
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,That sounds like a conspiracy theory
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",No,But also somewhat plausible
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:49 PM",Yes,ItÍs not like he was winning before this
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:50 PM",Yes,And I donÍt think he would be so desperately invoking the ClintonÍs past if he had anything to do with this 
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:50 PM",Yes,Odds of Trump still being candidate on election day
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:50 PM",Yes,70/30?
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:51 PM",Yes,Odds of Pence still being on the ticket if Trump is still candidate?
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:51 PM",Yes,55/45?
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:51 PM",No,I'd put both of those higher
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:52 PM",Yes,He has multiple senators calling for him to drop out
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:52 PM",Yes,And he tried to send Pence to RyanÍs event after Ryan uninvited him and Pence didnÍt go
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:52 PM",Yes,Plus Pence hasnÍt said anything publicly since the revelation
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:53 PM",Yes,Oh never mind Pence just said something
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:58 PM",No,I haven't heard the comments yet
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 1:58 PM",Yes,Trumps?
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:22 PM",No,Yeah
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:22 PM",Yes,Lol
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:23 PM",Yes,He said heÍs so rich he can just grab women by the pussy
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:23 PM",Yes,And was talking about trying to fuck a married woman (right after he got married to Melania)
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:32 PM",Yes,Wait also this was a conversation with Billy Bush
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:32 PM",Yes,Who is cousins with Jeb/George
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:32 PM",Yes,How the fuck did he not tell Jeb about it
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,It doesn't exactly put billy in good light either
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,Jeb!
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:33 PM",Yes,Jeb teaches at Harvard Kennedy School right now
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:33 PM",No,Plus Jeb is so low energy maybe he knew but just couldn't rouse the ambition to do anything 
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:33 PM",Yes,I should go ask him
18609676168,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:34 PM",No,Yeah
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,Just listened
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,To be fair it seems like he hit on the lady a while before the video was taken
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:56 PM",Yes,Why does that matter
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:56 PM",No,So it wasn't necessarily when he was married the melania
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:56 PM",Yes,I guess thatÍs debatable
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:57 PM",Yes,But dude straight up justified sexual assault
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:57 PM",No,"He did confirm that she was married when he ""moved on her"""
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,"And then obviously the ""grab by the pussy thing"""
18607168967,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:58 PM",No,I think he is done
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:58 PM",Yes,He can still lose every state
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 2:58 PM",Yes,He just needs to try
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 3:58 PM",Yes,
18609894948,"Oct 8, 2016, 4:02 PM",Yes,read this guys http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/politics/trump-on-howard-stern/index.html

18609894948,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:04 AM",Yes,That's similar to what I hit before dying badly 
18609894948,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:05 AM",Yes,A bit faster 
18609676168,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:05 AM",No,Yeah hopefully he doesn't die

18609676168,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:07 AM",No,Yeah
18609676168,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:07 AM",No,That's his goal
18609676168,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:08 AM",No,And then his stretch is to finish in top 1%
18609894948,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:09 AM",Yes,Did he run in high school?
18609676168,"Oct 9, 2016, 10:10 AM",No,Yeah

18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:26 PM",Yes,Which is weird
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:26 PM",No,Is it an iPhone?
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:27 PM",Yes,And I cracked the front today because my alarm wouldnÍt turn off so I threw it at the ground

18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:29 PM",Yes,The midterm is asking whether the FAA can regulate drones if Congress gave it the ability to regulate a long list of aircraft types that didnÍt include drones directly
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:30 PM",No,Are the things in it like drones?
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:30 PM",No,(Statutory construction with lists using that weird Latin name)
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:30 PM",No,"Does it seem like the statute includes other things, or will leave them out?"
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,When was it written?
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,(Did they know what a drone was then)
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,What does the legislative history say?
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:31 PM",Yes,The 40s. Drones existed but weren't common knowledge
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:31 PM",No,Are drones mentioned in old drafts or does a new draft mention them?
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:32 PM",Yes,Leg history indicates they wrote it to be broad but some congressmen privately had doubts of over regulating 
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:32 PM",Yes,Drones aren't mentioned at all
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:32 PM",No,What is the list?
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:32 PM",Yes,But yeah ejusdem generis and all that shot 
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:32 PM",No,"And does it say ""and so on"""
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:33 PM",No,"Yeah Michigan law is accredited, unlike brown"
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:36 PM",Yes,"ñpowered airplanes, helicopters, gliders and\LFother machines that are flown in the air.î "
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:36 PM",Yes,thats the def of aircraft
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,"Well since it is an exam question, it could go either way"
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,On the one hand... On the other hand
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,"You know about issue, rule, illustration, applicstion, conclusion right?"
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:37 PM",No,"(Or some similar thing, every prof says it differently)"
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:38 PM",Yes,IÍm pretty sure that the FAA is allowed to regulate and the key case is Babbit v Sweet Home
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:38 PM",No,Haha no law school exams don't have answers dude
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:38 PM",Yes,Babbit is the same case dude
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:39 PM",Yes,Can the EPA regulate habitat destruction 
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:39 PM",Yes,"If Congress said is is unlawful for any person to ñtakeî an endangered species and defines ñtakeî as ñharass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collectî"
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:41 PM",No,Wow. Just googled it
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:41 PM",No,Sounds like total bullshit
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:41 PM",Yes,Lol now whoÍs the Scalia backer
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:42 PM",No,I like textualism for the most part
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:42 PM",No,Scalia is a sophist btw
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:43 PM",Yes,This does seem like an easier case than Babbit because clearly ñother machines that are flown in the airî could be drones
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:43 PM",Yes,Whereas by no means is it obvious that ñtakeî includes habitat destruction
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:43 PM",No,But that was because the court was super liberal and into protecting habitats
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:44 PM",No,Now the court has some crazy nutjobs
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:44 PM",Yes,Still precedent
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:44 PM",No,Which court is deciding?
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:44 PM",Yes,I donÍt think weÍre supposed to consider that
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:45 PM",No,Yeah you only consider that for like conlaw
18609894948,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:45 PM",Yes,I think we are writing to inform a judge who is hearing this case what we think she should do
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:46 PM",No,She should recuse herself because she wrote the law
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:46 PM",No,And is a time traveler
18607168967,"Oct 12, 2016, 10:46 PM",No,Teist

18609676168,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:00 AM",No,(I think that came out more accusatory than I meant)
18609676168,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:00 AM",No,I'm genuinely curious
18605603559,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:01 AM",No,It might be an Asian thing
18605603559,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:01 AM",No,in china people flaunt all their expensive shit
18609676168,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:01 AM",No,Ah

18609894948,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:31 AM",Yes,After I did a good chunk of the midterm I realized thereÍs also a case going the exact opposite way
18609894948,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:31 AM",Yes,McBoyle v US holding that airplanes were not vehicles as defined by the National Motor Vehicle Act
18609894948,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:32 AM",Yes,Pretty similar to not holding drones to be airplanes in this one
18609894948,"Oct 13, 2016, 12:32 AM",Yes,Still arguing that they are
18607168967,"Oct 13, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,So every now and again I write in my notebook that I shouldn't have fucked up on the lsat
18607168967,"Oct 13, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,And I realized that I only do that during class dicussions
18607168967,"Oct 13, 2016, 11:55 AM",No,Because so many people say the stupidest shit and also word vomit
18607168967,"Oct 13, 2016, 11:57 AM",No,I'm at a talk about Isis that hasn't started yet

18609676168,"Oct 16, 2016, 4:07 PM",No,So the buyer gets the info when they pay
18609676168,"Oct 16, 2016, 4:07 PM",No,But the payment is held by a middleman until something occurs
18609676168,"Oct 16, 2016, 4:07 PM",No,And if that something doesn't occur the buyer gets refunded
18609676168,"Oct 16, 2016, 4:08 PM",No,So just replace that something with being insider trading info instead of murder detas
